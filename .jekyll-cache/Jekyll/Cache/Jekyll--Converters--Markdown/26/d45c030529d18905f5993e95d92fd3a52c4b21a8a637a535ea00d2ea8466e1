I"Œ<p>With my new Ubuntu installation taking shape there are only a few  things left to sort out to make it 100% functional as my primary web  developing machine. So far I have not regretted making the change,  especially as I can now run my beloved Ultraedit Studio within VMware on  a virtual XP machine. The transition has been pretty seamless, the  interface is intuitive and a pleasure to use. I have made a few minor  customisations to help increase productivity and changed the theme to  add a little eye candy.</p>
<p>The main change was  adding in the Compiz manager so that I could enable a few additional  desktop effects - specifically I added a 'hot corner' to the 'Scale'  effect so that I could use it as an entourage type screen switcher -  this also works great with VMware. Normally you need to press the 'ctrl'  + 'alt' key combo to release the mouse focus from the VM - setting a  hot corner to the top right of the screen means that the Scale effect is  called regardless - no need to press the key combo - simply moving the  mouse to the top right not only releases the mouse focus but also calls  the scale effect. Checkout the screenshot on the left - The VMware  screen integrates seamlessly with the rest of the applications. For the  best effect you should turn off the tabs, toolbar and summary so that  the VM looks like any other Application window. Click on the image to  open up a larger version.</p>
<p>Using VMware this way has allowed  me to retain the use of Ultraedit (which is good as  bought a lifetime  subscription - lol), but it does leave me with another small dilema -  what cvs program do I use?????</p>
<p>Up until now I have used Tortoise  CVS - an excellent program that integrated nicely into the windows  shell. For a while I also used the CVS built into Ultraedit but found  Tortoise to be far superior.</p>
<p>OK - No probs - I'll just carry on  using tortoise...... NOPE.......  only problem is that whilst the  Virtual Machine can write to the shared folder via the Samba server (see  <a href="../../index.php?page=home&amp;id=34">previous  article</a> for file sharing between Ubuntu and a windows Virtual  Machine) it does not seem to be able to use it for checking out CVS  projects, this is a bit of a problem for me as I always check out the  project files directly to my webserver root - I don't really want to  check them out and then have to move move them - thats far too much  work. The real solution is to find a suitable Linux CVS client. I guess  my prerequisites are that it needs to have some kind of graphical  interface or 'GUI' to be correct. I can't be bothered learning command  line interactions for updating / commiting / adding files via the  command line CVS client - and it needs to be compatible with the  Sourceforge repository.</p>
<p>A little Google later and I have installed  Crossvc (it's in the Ubuntu repository simply install it from  Synaptics. Without reading up I quickly added a profile with the server  info for the dmcms repository at Sourceforge. I then selected checkout  from the project menu - after selecting the destination folder, browsing  to the module I wanted to checkout and selecting a name for the folder I  had checked out the latest version of DMCMS and had it automatically  added to the Crossvc 'Workbench'. I had to manually type my password a  couple of times - but it worked like a dream - the interface readily  displays the current status of your project and also provides some nice  features like file compare and version history.</p>
<p>At the moment I  am trying to work out how to use my SSH key so that I only have to type  my password in once - When I've figured it out I will update this  post....</p>
