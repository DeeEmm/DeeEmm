I"´<p>The Boonex team have just released the not so long awaited 7.0.2 release. It seems that they have taken community comments about a shorter release cycle on board and trimmed down the releases to enable them to be released one a month. Got to admit, i was a little skeptical that they would pull it off, but its nice to be proven wrong. Lets hope that this is the shape of things to come.</p>
<p>The 7.0.2 release addresses a number of bugs and enhancements. It also removes the callbacks to the Boonex site to prevent the issues seen during the recent DDOS attacks, where many users were locked out of their admin panels.Probably the most important bug fixed is the bug that prevented profile fields from being updated, happily, this is now fixed.</p>
<p>i have already jumped in and upgraded my D7 site, and so far there are no issues.</p>
