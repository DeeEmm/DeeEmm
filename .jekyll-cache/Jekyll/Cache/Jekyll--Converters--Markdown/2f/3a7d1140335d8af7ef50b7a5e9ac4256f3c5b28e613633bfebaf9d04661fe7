I"c<p>We are pleased to announce that along side our hosting packages, we are now also able to offer hosted exchange email services. Our Hosted Exchange mail service runs Exchange 2007 and provides any number of mail boxes that you may require. There are no minimum numbers, and all packages come complete with Push email. Blackberry support can also be added if required.</p>
<p>As users of push technology, we decided to augment the standard email facilities provided with Exchange hosting. The ability to use Hosted Exchange is a great benefit to those clients that do not want to have the hassle of looking after their own servers. It also provides push technology to those clients using windows mobile or Blackberry devices, and our adoption of Exchange 2007 means that there is full integration with Apple OSX for Mail, Calendar and address book functions.</p>
<p>Our Exchange packages are run as separately service and do not require a hosting package to use.</p>
<p>More details to be posted soon, but if you cannot wait that long, please contact us to discuss your exchange requirements.</p>
