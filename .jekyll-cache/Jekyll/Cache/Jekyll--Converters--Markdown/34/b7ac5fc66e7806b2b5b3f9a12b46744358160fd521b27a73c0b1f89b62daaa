I"¹<p>I've been getting the framework of the safety analysis / risk assessment  software laid out to get a better idea of how to put it all together.  The basic underlying usability is simply to identify, score and then  reduce safety related hazards. The risk assessment process is pretty  straight forward, in fact I have been successfully using a risk  assessment model that I previously developed within excel. Along with  some different reporting options, these will both be carried over to the  software futher down the track.<br /><br />After doing a google I stumbled  across a rival peice of software. Marketed at up to $3300 per floating  user license I decided to take a look to see what the opposition had to  offer (mostly as it offered a free trial).<br /><br />The software was  pretty much as expected, and lacked ease of use for both the hazard  scoring and the reporting functions and nether aided the assessor or  provided any reccomendations based on the results. These are the main  areas where I feel this type of software should be of benefit.<br /><br />The  hazard identification aspect was relatively straight forward with pick  lists to pick from that also incorporated the ability to be able to add  user defined entries. Generally there appeared to be a lot of additional  'value added' aspects but when the extra options were scrutinised they  were no more than gloss and padding. <br /><br />In my mind, not worth the  stated $3300.</p>
