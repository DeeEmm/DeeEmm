I"M<p>A short time ago I upgraded the drive in my macbook pro as I had filled up the stock 250GB drive that came with it. After a little research I opted for the WD scorpio blue WD10TPVT 1 TB, as I had found out that even with it's increased height, it would still fit the macbook. But, after only a few months of use the drive has failed.</p>
<p>Fortunately the inbuilt S.M.A.R.T. check threw up an error message informing me of the impending doom, and advised me to back up my data pronto. As I could not get to a store until the weekend, I carried on using the drive for the rest of the week with no issues except running a tad slow.</p>
<p>One interesting thing that I noticed, is that, even though using OSX's 'Disk Utility', showed a S.M.A.R.T. failure (S.M.A.R.T. is a hardware check carried out by onboard diagnostics within the drive unit), Tech Tool's S.M.A.R.T. test passed as okay.</p>
<p>So, I went out at the weekend to buy a replacement drive, and to post the failed unit off for&nbsp;warrantee&nbsp;repair, as it is covered for 3 years. Unfortunately the store did not have a 1TB unit, so I purchased a WD 500GB black unit instead.&nbsp;Interestingly the store owner commented that they had stopped stocking the larger drive due to the high failure rate.&nbsp;It seems that this is one of those cases where bigger is most&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;not better.</p>
<p>My guess is that the larger drive is more fragile than its smaller counterparts and had failed as a result. I travel quite a lot, and so I quite often pack up my macbook whilst it is in standby / sleep mode, normally this is no issue, but I think in this case, with the more fragile drive, it simply did not fare too well.</p>
<p>So if you're thinking of upgrading to a 1TB drive, consider how your laptop will be treated, as it might mean your drive fails sooner than expected.</p>
