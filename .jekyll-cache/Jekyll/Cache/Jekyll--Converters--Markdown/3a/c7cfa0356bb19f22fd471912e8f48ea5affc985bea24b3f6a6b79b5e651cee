I"æ<p>With the recent update of a site I help manage and some discussions about a new direction for DMCMS towards the social networking side of town I stumbled across a mod for phpBB that allows users to create thier very own blog. The mod, known as 'The Blog Mod' seems to have a very chequered history and is difficult to find somewhere that currently supports it. <br /><br />Trawling through the phpBB mods forums I found out that the original author (Hyperion) seemed to simply dissappear, A deluge of posting then raised the concern that the mod would simply die without some kind of rescue attempt - so another topic was started to discuss the relevent merits of saving the mod. The outcome of that discussion was that yet another topic was started to support the newly ressurrected 'Blog Mod' - after the topic was blasted for not being in the specific phpBB mod style, and the original auther gracefully backed out of thier offer of support yet another thread was started and the mod lived on...<br /><br />That was until about February when the official development thread on phpBB was locked. In addition the official website at <span class="postbody"><a href="http://www.theblogmod.com/" target="_blank">http://www.theblogmod.com</a> seems to have died about August time last year.<br /><br />It seems a shame that there is so much beurocracy over at phpBB that what appears to have been quite a well respected mod has now had the plug pulled on it by the closure of the thread, as for what happened to the official site, who knows?<br /><br />A little digging has found a few links to sites still hosting 'The Blog Mod' - <br /><a href="http://forum.khurram.ca/viewtopic.php?p=1248" target="_blank"><br />http://forum.khurram.ca/viewtopic.php?p=1248</a> </span></p>
