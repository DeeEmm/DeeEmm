I"1<p>{jcomments off}The automated user registration is now up and running on my test  server. There are still some things to iron out and a few features to  add to make administration easier but the basic system is in place and  working.</p>
<p>I'm currently working on the backup / alternate method of  user account activation so that, if required, activation can be done by  administrators - this is usefull in cases where there is no access to a  mail server or where site admins like to personally check and manually  enable all registrations.</p>
