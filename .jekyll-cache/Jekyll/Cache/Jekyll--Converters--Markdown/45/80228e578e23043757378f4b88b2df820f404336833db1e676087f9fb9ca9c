I"v<p>As regular readers would know, I have recently changed my primary  operating system over to Ubuntu. This computer is mostly used for web  development so running a Linux based system makes sense as the end  platorm I write for is Linux based.<br /><br />On Windows I usually use <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/">WampServer</a> to host and test PHP  code on my local machine, this is basically an AMP stack (Apache2 + PHP5  + MySQL) bundled with phpMyAdmin and a nice task bar 'applet'  where  you can change settings, start / stop the server etc.. All of this is  installed from a sinle installer file - things don't get much more  convenient than that.<br /><br />To make my Ubuntu (Desktop version)  installation more useable I needed to install the LAMP stack but this  involved installing the components seperately. This isn't really that  hard but it does require using the terminal and typing some commands in.  Incidently, you can use Ubuntu server version which already has this  set up, but being aimed at use as a server it is void of other programs.<br /><br />Installation  of the AMP stack is best carried out in order - this is basically  Apache &gt; PHP &gt; SQL.<br /><br />To install Apache2 you will need to use  the following command - <br /><br />sudo apt-get install apache2<br /><br />You  may get an error as follows - "<em>apache2: Could not determine the  serverâ€™s fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.0.1" </em>this is  easily remedied by adding the following line to your httpd.conf file</p>
<p>ServerName  localhost</p>
<p>You can call the file up in the text editor by using  the following command</p>
<p>gksudo gedit /etc/apache2/httpd.conf</p>
<p>Now  you can install php5 and MySQL by using the following command</p>
<p>sudo  apt-get install mysql-server libapache2-mod-auth-mysql php5-mysql</p>
<p>That's  it - You now have a working test server, you should be able to view the  Apache test page by typing <a href="http://localhost/" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outbound/article/localhost');">http://localhost</a> or <a href="http://127.0.0.1/" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker  ('/outbound/article/127.0.0.1');">http://127.0.0.1</a> in to your  browser. The server root is located at ./var/www - just add your php  files and you are done.</p>
<p>If, like me you use phpMyAdmin to manage  your SQL databases you can easily install it by using the following  command</p>
<p>sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin</p>
<p>It will ask you  which Apache installation you want to install it for - make sure that  you select Apache2 by pressing the space bar before continuing and  pressing enter - if you forget to do this it will not install the  symbolic link allowing you to type http://localhost/phpmyadmin into your  browser to access it. It will also ask you to set a password for the  root account (a good idea).</p>
<p>Once installed you can access  phpMyAdmin by typing <a href="http://localhost/phpmyadmin" target="_blank">http://localhost/phpmyadmin</a> into your browser.</p>
<p>Finally  - if, like me you use Ubuntu you might want to change the permissions  of the 'www' folder so that you have read / write access from within  your normal user account - to do this type 'gksudo nautilus' into a  terminal window - this will open up Nautilus as root allowing you to  change folder permissions to suit.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to  change the location of the webservers root to within your home folder  you can edit the virtual hosts file. you can do this by typing the  following comment into a terminal</p>
<p>sudo gedit  /etc/apache2/sites-available/default</p>
<p>This opens up the Virtual  hosts file for editing. Simply replace the current information pointing  to the /var/www/ folder with the path to a folder in your home directory  - ie /home/username/web/. By doing this typing http://locahost will  take you to the 'web' folder in your home directory. Dont forget to  restart the Apache service after making any changes by issuing the  following command</p>
<p>sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</p>
<p>With  an up and running webserver I can now move my development files across  and also add whatever databases I need. The only thing I can't do is  access any files from within XP in VMWare. This is easily rectified.</p>
<p>VMWare  Workstation comes with the ability to share folders between the host  and client, VMWare Server unfortunately does not. This is not a problem  as files can be shared by using the Samba filesharing server. There are a  number of different ways of doing this but the following way suited me  best.<br /><br />Install Samba by issuing the following command<br /><br />sudo  apt-get install samba smbfs<br /><br />Now edit the smb.conf file <br /><br />sudo  gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf<br /><br />Uncomment the following line <br /><br />security  = user<br /><br />and make sure that the workgroup name is set to the same  as the workgroup in your XP virtual machine. <br /><br />now add a password  for your user account by using the following command<br /><br />sudo  smbpasswd -a username<br /><br />(Obviously replacing username for your  username)<br /><br />Restart the Samba service by using the following  command<br /><br />sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart<br /><br />Ok. Now all you  need to do is share the folders that you want to access from within your  XP virtual machine.<br /><br />Open Nautilus as root<br /><br />gksudo nautilus<br /><br />Now  navigate to the folders you want to share and simply right click on  them. From the menu select 'Share Folder' and select 'share through  windows network snb'</p>
<p>(Note, if you want to share files / folders  from within your own home folder you do not need to open Nautilus as  root)</p>
<p>Now you can acces the files / folders by browsing to them via  network neighborhood or by using the address in the following format<br /><br />\\Computername\Foldername</p>
<p>Next  I need to install a CVS Client but more about that later...</p>
