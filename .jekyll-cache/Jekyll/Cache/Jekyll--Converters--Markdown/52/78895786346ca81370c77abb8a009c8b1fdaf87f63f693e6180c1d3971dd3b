I"Š<p>For those of you who have been using Dolphin for a while, you will remember that Boonex used to offer a free RMS hosting service for it's free licenses. This service has long since been discontinued, leaving users to either ensure that they find a combined Web / RMS hosting package, or look for a third party RMS host.</p>
<p>Smoge over at ModMySite, has recently introduced a free RMS hosting package on their own servers, for small low bandwidth sites. There are also a variety of paid packages that should support all sizes of sites from small to large.</p>
<p>ModMySite, are a long time Dolphin support site that has been around since the original days of AEDating, way back in 2003, so theyÂ certainlyÂ knowÂ theirÂ stuff.</p>
