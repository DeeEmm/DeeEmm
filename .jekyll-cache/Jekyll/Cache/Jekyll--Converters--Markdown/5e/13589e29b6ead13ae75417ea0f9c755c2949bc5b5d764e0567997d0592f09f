I"š<p>Just figuring out how to use Jekyll <del>and migrate my existing page here from DeeEmm.com</del> now that I have migrated my blog here from DeeEmm.com</p>

<p>Iâ€™m so used to editing in HTML, gonna have to get used to markup. To be honest Iâ€™, not sure whatâ€™s best, after all HTML is itself markup language. I kinda like the purity of HTML and CSS, even though I entrust my web site to a CMS (which is pretty much like cheating)</p>

<p>So I guess that moving to jekyll is probably halfway between the two. Not quite as pure as writing in HTML &amp; CSS, but not quite as dirty as using a CMS.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m also telling myself that this move is going to reignite my blog a little. I do lots of projects on many different things, many of which I â€˜blogâ€™ about elsewhere. SO I would like to start posting more of that stuff here.</p>

<p>For example, I have a bunch of Github projects that I never really include here, so moving â€˜hereâ€™ to Github should really mean that I include those projects a lot more.</p>

<p>I guess we will see.</p>

<p>Right now I have to migrate images and write some scripts to change a whole bunch of dead links in my EasyBlog import</p>

<p>BTW. Iâ€™m writing this in â€˜Proseâ€™, an online editor. Itâ€™s kinda cool. Nice and clean, no distractions, just a very basic source editor, it has a preview butting and a save button and thatâ€™s about it. I think I might grow to like this. :)</p>
