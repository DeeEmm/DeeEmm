<p>First impressions of UEX are exactly as expected. UEX is very similar visually to UEDIT and UEStudio. It differs in that there are a few features that are missing or different, but it likely that these will appear with the final release.<br /><br />We've been using Ubuntu 9.04 to run the UEX beta on, and we've been using it for the current re-write / tidying of the DMCMS version 1 release. So far our findings with UEX are pretty much as expected with a beta release, mostly the code works as expected, but with the occasional bug / hangup. Hopefully our dilligence with reporting the errors will mean that RC1 will as robust we have all come to expect Ultraedit to be, and that the final release of UEX is not too far behind it.</p>
<p>There are also rumors of a mac port of UEX, although there is no timeline currently available for it. My guess is that once UEX is up and running it will be little matter to port it to the mac platform.</p>
<p>The version 1 release for DMCMS has been delayed to include some new developments, including the addition of an all new tiny_mce and image browser and the seperation of the administration functions from the main code, this will allow faster page load times and also increase security. It's maybe a little different from our original goal of getting the version 1 release out into the wild, but we figured the extra wait would be worth it.</p>
<p>We will keep you posted on both UEX and DMCMS version 1.</p>
