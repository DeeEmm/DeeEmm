I"‰<p>If you are new to Joomla / JomSocial there are a few handy things to know...<br /><br />Joomla 'Modules' are similar to Dolphin 'Blocks' you can change module types <br />and positions in the admin panel. Modules are available for many extensions to <br />help display data FROM the extension on your site. eg latest forum posts. <br /><br />Module positions are set in the template. To view available module positions <br />you can add the following to the end of the URL ?tp=1 You will need to also <br />enable this in the template for the module positions to be displayed.<br /><br />Menus are also controlled by modules, so to add a menu you need to add a menu module to <br />the relevent module position. Check out the standard modules to get an idea of <br />how they work. This means you can have multiple menus.<br /><br />Extensions are similar to dolphin modules. You can search for extensions in the <br />'JED' (Joomla Extensions Directory). Most Jooma extensions are free. <br />Make sure you select extensions that are compatible with your installation <br />version. Also, read the comments as they most often give a good idea of the <br />provenance of the extension.<br /><br />As JomSocial is a joomla extension, to get other extensions to interact with it, <br />it might be necessary to install plugins. So when looking for extension, check <br />to see if they are JomSocial compatible. <br /><br />For example. Installing the kunena JomSocial plugin allows the kunena posts to <br />be included in the JomSocial activity feed. <br /><br />To install an component / extension. <br /><br />1/ Log INTO the admin control panel at http://yoursite.com/administrator <br />2/ Browse to extensions &gt; extension manager<br />3/ Click the 'choose file' button in the 'upload package file' section, <br />4/ Browse to the extension package (it should be a zip file) <br />5/ Hit 'upload &amp; install' button<br /><br />The Extension will automagically be installed. <br /><br />Check the 'Components' menu as there should now be a link to administrate your new component.<br /><br />If the installation fails it will tell you with an error message.<br /><br /></p>
