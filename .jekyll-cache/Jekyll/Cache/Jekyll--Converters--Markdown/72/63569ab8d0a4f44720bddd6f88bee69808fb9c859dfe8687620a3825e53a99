I"Â<p>Boonex regulars will know that there is soon to be a new policy put in place in Unity, instant bans for anything spoken out of line. There will be no opinions about Dolphin allowed, unless they are positive, and no critiques.</p>
<p>Of course, this will probably mean that i will not last too long, I am, of course, very outspoken when it comes to Dolphin and their developers, and it is only my good nature that prevents me from saying more.</p>
<p>So in response to a forum post, that I am sure will get deleted, and more than likely get me banned, i posted the following.</p>
<pre><em>It will never change, you can disappear for 2 years and then come back here and things will be exactly like they were when you left. (except that the version number will be different) . </em><br /><em>On returning, at first things may appear to be different, as they will be dressed up in a different way, but the same issues will persist, the same complaints will be made about how the issues are handled, the same regulars will be in the forums complaining about how crap the support is, the same webmasters will be holding out, waiting for the magic version that will allow them to take their sites live, and the same core developers will be selling mods that should be core features.</em><br /><br /><em>As I know that this will be deleted - I've also posted this on my site - to prove a point. Come back and check in 2 years - It will be the same - I will stake money on it.</em></pre>
<p>To put it in context, it's a thread complaining about Dolphin, how buggy it is, and how Boonex handle management of it. My response is just some thoughts about how it always seems to be the same.</p>
<p>I originally looked at Dolphin a number of years ago and was turned off by the community reports about how many bugs it had, I returned to it about 2 years back, where I decided that it was stable enough to use for a project. Over this time, I have come to learn that not much has changed since my initial investigation all those years ago, and I am prepared to lay money that it will be the same in two years time.</p>
<p>So, to preserve the post for prosperity, I have quoted it here in this blog.</p>
<p>See you on the 5th August 2012.</p>
