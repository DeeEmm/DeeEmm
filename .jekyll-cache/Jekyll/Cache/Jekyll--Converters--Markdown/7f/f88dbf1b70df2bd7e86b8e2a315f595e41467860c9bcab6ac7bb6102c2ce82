I"„<p>I will be taking some time out this week to get some stuff done around  the house, this means it is likely that I won't be sitting in front of  my computer too much. I've been spending too much time trying to get  everything finished off and neglecting my chores (which doesn't bode too  well with the better half).<br /><br />After a quick tot-up I estimate that  there are approximately 80 hours work left until the next (and  hoipefully final) release is ready. There are a lot of new features  planned including a full user based commenting / subscription system,  reinstatement of the translation function (obviously working this time  round) as well as a completely redesigned administration interface.<br /><br />A  lot of the work has already been carried out and tested but will  require further testing to make sure that it is reliable enough for  release. The remaining items are either still in development or have yet  to be started.<br /><br />The current release is hopefully stable enough  that it will not cause any problems and so will likely remain as it is  until the final release is ready.<br /><br />Some minor bug fixes have  already been released and the packages updated to reflect the bugs  found. <br /><br />As usual, if you find any errors / problems / bugs then  don't hesitate to bring them to our attention, either as a Bug Tracker  entry or in the forums.<br /><br />DM.</p>
