	  <div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p><span>If you've read <a href="https://deeemm.com/index.php/entry/general/lanthanum-chloride-dosing" title="" class="">my post on dosing Lanthanum Chloride</a> you might be trying to work out how to drip&nbsp;dose. Dosing machines tend to have programs that work for periodical dosing and not constant dosing, so they are not great when it comes to the regular drip-drip style dosing you need for Lanthanum Chloride.<br /><br />The best solution by far is to the regular hospital&nbsp;style drip bags and drop counter. This allows you to count drops, adjust the flow&nbsp;and calculate a dosing rate based on the frequency that the drops drip at, (or is that drips drop at?) Of course not everybody has access to that kind of stuff or else are impatient like me, and so&nbsp;need&nbsp;a DIY solution.</span></p><p>The solution to this problem is actually quite a simple&nbsp;DIY solution that can easily be made from those surplus bits and bobs you have laying around.</p><p><span>My DIY drip doser is made from an old ginger beer bottle. It has&nbsp;two holes in the lid with silicone tube.&nbsp;I used a glass bottle rather than something like a plastic drink bottle so that you could not accidentally&nbsp;squeeze it and overdose the tank.</span></p><p><span>O</span><span>ne hole&nbsp;</span><span>has a short length of silicone tube in it, this is the outlet. I</span><span>t should pushed in only far enough to make a seal.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Tip: The further into the bottle you push the outlet tube, the more solution will be left in the bottle</span></p><p><span>The other hole has a longer piece of tube in it that reaches all the way&nbsp;to the top of the&nbsp;inside and all the way to the top on the outside.. The&nbsp;outside&nbsp;end of the longer tube&nbsp;has a regular air line valve in it to regulate the flow. You can easily use this valve to dial in the flow to what you need.&nbsp;I have mine set to&nbsp;drip&nbsp;at about a rate of about 1 drop every 5 seconds. <br /><br />Tip:&nbsp;The outside length of tube is longer to allow you tie it up and prevent it from falling into the water, which will stop the doser from working</span></p><p><span>The bottle needs to be inverted after you have filled it, you might want to do this over a sink or toilet the first time as it has a tendency to let a little 'squirt' out whilst the pressure differential inside and outside of the bottle equalises.<br /><br />So how fast to dose?&nbsp;It's generally accepted that a&nbsp;drop is approximately&nbsp;0.05 mL So you can use this value to help calculate your dosing regimen. Depending on what you are dosing, you may also be able to dilute it if you wish to dose slower than your valve will allow, or use a higher concentration if you wish to dose faster.</span></p><p>The amount I'm dosing with my Lanthanum chloride is relatively weak, so it would not cause an issue if the entire bottle ended up in the tank.</p><p><span>If you want to gain some confidence on whether your DIY doser works, just fill it up with tank water and set it dosing, then measure how long it takes to dose the bottle.<br /><br />/DM<br /><br /></span></p></div>

	  <div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>So a year down the track after building my <a href="https://deeemm.com/index.php/entry/general/diy-cheato-reactor" title="" class="">algae reactor</a> I've given up using it due to poor results. In the mean time I've tried a few other things to get my phos levels down...</p></div>
<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="readmore"></div>
<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p><span>Growth was not as good as I would have liked with the algae reactor&nbsp;and in all honesty it could not compete with the display. So I decommissioned the algae reactor and filled it up with PhosGuard. The&nbsp;PhosGuard was better, but it was an expensive solution. I then tried GFO in the hope that it would last longer / be better than the PhosGuard&nbsp;but again, it did little to the levels and was expensive to maintain.</span></p>		<p><br /></p><p>Right about the time of Covid my roll filter decided to strip a gear which put it out of action. This meant that I had to stop using the GFO&nbsp;as I had no way to take the fine particles out of the water, so my tank essential was left to go fallow. I ended up with a LOT of algae in the display tank. I was too embarrassed to take a photo.&nbsp;</p><p>So when the replacement part finally arrived (two weeks ago) the tank had lain fallow for six months. Fortunately the algae was pretty easy to remove, it just lifted out. I ended up with a half a bucket.<br /><br />So what to do about this phosphate issue?<br /><br />I decided to use Lanthanum Chloride. I had read about this last year when I researched the algae reactor, but general consensus was that it was too dangerous to use. Of course, such advice is usually just anecdotal. More recently I ended up reading a few articles where people were successfully using it as part of their tank regimen with no issues. I also read about a fella who had used Hy-Chlor - a readily available pool cleaning chemical here in South Australia. Preferring DIY solutions for tank husbandry this seemed just the ticket.</p><p>So after a trip to our local DIY shop I ended up with a litre bottle of Hy-Chlor for the paltry sum of AU$30.&nbsp;I mixed up a solution of 1ml of hy-chlor to 1 litre of RO water and made a crude drip doser and then dosed the tank over an 8 hour period. I measured the phos levels the next day, the level had halved.&nbsp;<br /><br />WOOT!</p><p>I left the tank for a day.&nbsp;Further dosing using half of the amount (0.5ml in 1/2 litre) saw my levels drop to just over zero.</p><p>WOOT!</p><p>That's the lowest the Phos level has been since I started measuring it</p><p>I&nbsp;left the tank for a few days. Measuring the phos levels again saw them rise, which is completely expected as the phos will be leaching back out of the rock and substrate. One thread I read had a tank owner saying that it had taken over a year to get this leaching under control, so I expect that I have a long journey ahead. The great thing is that the chemical is dirt&nbsp;cheap ($30 for a litre) and so will last a LOOOOONG time.&nbsp;</p><p>Next step is to set up some kind of dosing setup.&nbsp;I do however need to exercise some caution and get a test kit so that I can also test for free&nbsp;LaCl3 in the water. Eventually when the phos has depleted the free&nbsp;LaCl3 levels will rise in the water column, if this level is allowed to rise&nbsp;too high it will become lethal to the tank. The highest safe&nbsp;concentration documented is 1mg/l, which is a massively high amount compared to the amount I'm dosing, but if left unchecked, especially if auto dosing the stuff, it could soon build up.</p><p>Other users use a higher dose periodically to bring the phos levels down and then let them rise up again. I'm not sure if this is the best option for me with the&nbsp;leeching LR. What I want to try and do is match the dosing rate to the leeching rate so that it does not bring the phos down to zero but some small value instead. This way I should be able to detect when the leeching has subsided as the phos levels will then drop to zero. Well that's the theory at any rate.</p><p>In summary, LaCl3 does not appear to be as dangerous or&nbsp;difficult to use as many have made it sound. Just use dilute amounts, over a period of time interspaced with phosphate testing&nbsp;and you will be fine.&nbsp;The results I have seen are very promising and I feel that&nbsp;as long as I test the free LaCl3 in the water column I cannot see why it should be an issue.&nbsp;</p><p>If you do use this method you will need a fine (10 micron) filter setup to remove the flocculant from the water (LaCL3 bonds with the phosphate to turn it into a solid that needs to be removed by filtration). I dose into my weir, which goes directly to my roll filter, this gives a fair amount of reaction time without the LaCl3 reaching the tank. It's quite satisfying to watch the roll filter going crazy as the LaCl3 is dosed. Others place a filter sock in a high flow area in their sump and dose into that instead. Whatever method you use it seems that general consensus is to try and catch the flocculant and prevent it from going into the tank as it can irritate some fish. This is evidently more prevalent with tangs, however I have a blue tang in my tank which has not been bothered at all. Maybe this is related to the small dose, so there is less free LaCl3 in the water column.</p></div>
<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Some details on my dosing</strong></p><p>I'm using Hy-Chlor pool phosphate remover - it's AU$30 for 1 litre - <a href="https://www.bunnings.com.au/hy-clor-1l-pool-phosphate-remover_p3090143" title="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.bunnings.com.au/hy-clor-1l-pool-phosphate-remover_p3090143</a> It's essentially pure LaCl3 diluted in solution. There are no other chemicals noted in the 'ingredients'</p><p>Hy-Chor contains a concentration of 150mg/litre of LaCl3</p><p>I diluted it at a ratio of 1ml into a litre of RO water</p><p>This brings the actual concentration down to 0.15mg/litre</p><p>This is then dosed into my system which is 233 litres over about 12 hours. (some dose this amount much quicker but I prefer to err on the side of caution) </p><p>This means that the actual concentration in my tank is potentially as high as 0.00064mg/litre assuming that none of it gets consumed by phosphate and it stays in it's initial state. Of course the LaCl3 is consumed and precipitated out as a solid which further reduces the amount of free LaCl in the tank.</p><p>To get to dangerous HcLa3 levels (assuming the 1mg / litre threshold) it would take me 1553.5 litres of this solution to bring the LaCl3 level in the tank up to 1mg/litre.</p><p>That means there's lots of room for raising the dosing strength, but given I have seen promising results from the small dose I have been using I will stick with the current regimen. There is also the phosphate level itself to consider, it dropped down to near zero levels with the testing that I undertook, a higher dosing level / rate would strip the phosphate level <em data-redactor-tag="em">too</em> low which would not be good for the tank as some trace levels of phosphate are required for the corals. Likewise too high a dose of LaCl3 will leave unreacted LaCl3 free to enter into the display, where it will be free to bond with phosphate sources there. This would probably result in flocculant being created on the surface of the live rick and substrate as the phosphate leeches out. This flocculant would then be free to float around and may irritate tank inhabitants as previously described.</p><p>I'll get it set up and do some further testing and then report back here after a period of time with how things are going. Hopefully it will be some positive news</p><p>/DM</p></div>

	  <div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>I'm setting up a <a href="https://reef-pi.github.io/" title="" class="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reef-pi</a> controller on my tank. Reef-Pi is a DIY Raspberry-Pi based aquarium controller.&nbsp;I had considered making a simple controller using an Arduino, but when i was searching online I found&nbsp;the Reef-Pi project and decided it was perfect for my needs and would save a bunch of work and time. Win-Win!</p><p><br /></p></div>
<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="readmore"></div>
<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>The main reason I was considering some kind of tank controller was just to control my lights with the eventual goal of building some DIY LED Lights. I also quite like the idea of switching all of my pumps to DC pumps powered by a solar charged battery bank to help save on electricity costs and overcome power outages, so moving to a centralised controller would make this possible. I'm not 100% sure if reef-pi will be able to control the main pump in this manner but it's something that can be looked into down the track, it certainly has the capability to control DC pumps and so looks like it will&nbsp;be able to do the job.</p><p>For the time being I'll concentrate on getting the pi set up with some simple on / off relay control and dimming control for the existing LED lighting and control of the tanks heaters. There is also the possibility to integrate things like Auto Top Up, doser&nbsp;control, PH monitoring,&nbsp;feeder control, etc. In fact there is a pretty flexible macro system that means it can potentially control many different things.</p><p>So I decided to invest some time into putting a Reef-Pi system together with the end&nbsp;goal of complete tank control, whatever that looks like.</p></div>

	  <p>Why is it that plugin and extension designers feel the need to make their admin interfaces completely different from the parent product? Bright colours and shitty icons make their admin interfaces look like a garish nightmare. Same with the front end renderings as well.

	  <div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>I've had this vinyl cutter for 6 years and in all of that time its probably only clocked up a handful of hours. It's essential like new.&nbsp;The reason for this is due to the crappy software that was supplied with the machine. The manufacturers supplied&nbsp;'Make-the-Cut', a buggy, non-intuitive, non-metric, not-supported-since-1882,&nbsp;java based program that was simply awful. What's worse is that the machines are not supported by other regular programs so options are limited.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently I upgraded my Mac and found that Make-the-Cut did not 'make the cut' as it will not work on a 64 bit machine running Catalina. What's worse is that a trip to the MTC website showed me that MTC appears to be no more as the website is dead. Great!&nbsp;</p><p>KnK now ships a version of&nbsp;'Sure Cuts a Lot'&nbsp;with its machines.&nbsp;The $300 'Sure Cuts a Lot' program shares the same daft naming convention as the previous 'Make-the-Cut software and also the 'Klic-n-Kut' brand. It also appears to be written with the same outdated 1990s Javascript IDE. The hairs on the back of my neck stand up just looking at the awful interface, on the awful website. I can tell that it's not really going to be any better than the&nbsp;buggy, non-intuitive, non-metric,&nbsp;Make-the-Cut software. (ohh, what an ironic name).0</p><p>So a while back (6 months back in fact) I took a look at <a href="https://codelv.com/projects/inkcut/" title="InkCut">Inkcut</a>, a cutter program that can be used with inkscape. I was <a href="https://inkcut.org/t/knk-zing-compatibility/40/#post-253" title="Attempt #1">unable to get it working at the time</a> but now faced with no option other than to cough up AU$300 for 'Sure Cuts a lot' I decided to have another go.</p><p>After a bit if a hiatus from looking at this it didn't actually take that long to get it working. Fortunately there are enough parameters in the Inkcut setup to cater for a variety of setups&nbsp;including the KnK Zing Air machine that I have. For anyone else who wants to have a go, here's the setup I used.&nbsp;Essentially you have to manually create a printer driver using CUPs. Then setup Inkcut to use the appropriate protocol and commands to be able to talk to the cutter.<br /></p><p><span>On my machine the printer was not automatically detected as a printer and so did not appear in the OSX 'add-a-printer' dialog.

	  <div class="es-stream-content  es-story--bg-0">Managed to scrounge half an hour on the cyclekart this evening. I laid out some string to take a look at what I needed to do to get the steering arms made up. The string helps to plot a line from the front steering pivots through the center of the rear axle. The steering arm pivots must fall on this line for the correct ackermann angles.<p>I needed to make a curved arms so that on full lock the arms do not interfere with the front beam. I found some suitable flat bar from the scrap pile and set about bending it to make up a couple of arms. I used some heat on the inside of the bend to help 'shrink' the metal. This is better than applying heat to the outside of the bend which will 'stretch' the metal. Shrinking the metal in this way means that the metal is actually thicker on the inside of the bend, which makes it stronger. I also had to straighten it out a little on my bench anvil just to remove some minor kinks from the heating and bending. </p><p>The arms will also need to be reinforced with a small gusset underneath to give it some added strength. I will also add a steering stop to prevent the wheel from touching the body, this will be a simple hard stop that the steering arm comes into contact with at the end of its movement. Hopefully I should be able to cut the flat bar in the middle of the bend and make an arm for the left and right sides.<br /></p></div>

	  <div class="es-stream-content  es-story--bg-0">Finally got around to making a start on the rear axle. I worked out the length, cut the bar stock down and turned one end to size in the lathe. I still need to do the other end and cut some threads in the ends. The drive hub, bearings and wheel hub now fit perfectly.<p>I also made a start on the motor mount. I cut some plate to span between two cross members, this will support the motor. I'm still trying to figure out the best way to set up the chain drive. I rotated the torque converter downwards to see how the path of the chain was to the drive pulley, but it clashes with the cross member. Need to finalise this before I can move on. So slow progress, but progress none-the-less.										</p></div>

	  <div class="es-stream-content  es-story--bg-0">Did a bit more on the cyclekart yesterday. Managed to get the front wheels fitted up. I made up some 20mm spacers on the lathe to space the wheel out a little from the pivot so that the hub did not bind when the wheels were turned. I also had to add a spacer to the outside of the wheel as the bolts I used were a little too long. I pressed the new bearings into the hubs and mounted the wheels up.<p>I checked the steering range, which seems fine, although I will lose a little of this when it is finally connected up. Next is to finalise the rear axle location so that I can determine the correct ackermann angle for the steering arm geometry.</p><p>I also took delivery of the 6mm broach that I ordered. This is for broaching the keyways into the rear hubs. Now I have no excuses not to get the rear axle finished (although I've actually ordered some different bearings <img class="emoji" src="https://cyclekarts.com.au/media/com_easysocial/images/icons/emoji/happy.png" width="20" height="20" alt="image" /> ).</p><p>Also spent a bit of time trying to figure out the correct dimensions and proportions for the layout. I'm about 80% with that. </p><p>The kids showed a bit of interest too, which was cool. I think that now it has some wheels on it and it's on the stands they can visualise it a bit better.

One of the main aims was to clear enough space to get the cyclekart chassis up on some trestles and get the motor mounting and rear axle sorted out. So tonight I managed to clear enough space to get the chassis up and at a nice height to work on.</p><p>With the chassis up in the air, I offered the engine and rear drive sprocket up on the chassis only to realise that the rear cross brace is in the way. I will probably have to remove, move or modify the rear cross brace on the chassis as it clashes with the drive sprocket. This is as a result of using a slightly shorter chassis rail than the plans specified. I did this so that I could get two side rails from the standard length of RHS.</p><p>It's no big drama really. I've still got plenty of welding on do on the chassis as I need to make and weld in the remainder of the cross bracing for the floor and underside so I will figure something out for the rear section.</p><p>I also think I need to get a side profile of my tribute car sorted out so that I can scale the dimensions and figure out where I need to put the bulkheads and top cowl support loops. Getting the proportions right is going to be important.</p><p>But whilst talking and thinking about what I need to do is all very well, I still need to find the time to actually do some work proper. The only actual work I did tonight was to flip the bearings in their holders so that the collars were on the 'outside'. </p><p>Hopefully now that I have it in a position where I can actually do some work I will now be able to grab the odd hour here and there and make some progress.										</p></div>

I did manage to do a few little jobs, but no major progress since picking up the wheels.<p>I picked up some 6mm end mills and M25 nuts + nylocks the other day, which means that I now have no excuse not to finish off my rear axle. When I say 'finish off the axle' I actually mean somehow turn the length of 1" steel I bought into something that more resembles an axle. I need ot machine 6mm slots for the keyways and turn threads on the ends for holding the wheels on. I also picked up some bolt on axle collars which I *think* I might use as the inner location for the wheels. What I overlooked with the axle / wheel setup is that a 25mm shaft with a 25mm hub has no shoulder against which the hub can sit, so the axle clamps should hopefully solve this oversight. I assume that this is how they are set up on go karts.</p><p>I still have to figure out a few details on how to bolt everything up but I'll probably just wing it like usual.

	  <div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>I built an MPCNC a while back and am&nbsp;finally getting around to finishing it off. My machine is a combined use CNC and 3D printer so I have elected to use Marlin software. The main use for my machine is 3D printing using a direct granule extruder that I am developing for use with recycled plastics, this requires a larger format and heavier machine than a regular 3D printer due to the size of the extruder. I also have plenty of aluminium CNC work for it, so it's very much a dual use machine.&nbsp;<br /></p></div>
<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="readmore"></div>
<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>One aspect that I wanted to add was a jog-wheel control, so that I could control it in the same manner as other CNCs I have used, but being controlled by 3D printer software it does not lend itself well to traditional CNC controls. After looking around for such a solution I did not really see something that worked exactly as I wanted. There are a few solutions using G-Code parsers to send G-Code to the controller, but the issue with using these with a jogwheel is that a small flick of the wheel produces many G-code move commands, which are buffered in the machines memory. This means that the machine will continue to move long after the jog wheel has stopped, resulting in a large overshoot and difficult control characteristics.<br /><br />My initial solution was to modify the Marlin code to accept direct input from the jogwheel, but then I came across Jamies joystick solution over at the MPCNC forums and decided that I could leverage this as the protocol for my jog-wheel control.<br /><br />Essentially what I have created is an external controller that mimics the joystick and is connected to the same inputs used by the joystick. This connects to Marlin in the standard manner defined by Jamies code, which has now been added to the latest Marlin 2.0 release. This means that there are no code hacks to maintain and no code to change, just the standard connections and standard setup you would have to go through if you were hooking up a regular joystick.<br /><br />Here's how it works: The regular joystick control comprises of three potentiometers for X,Y and Z respectively. Using three voltage controlled resistors (VCRs) we can easily make the Arduino mimic the potentiometers within the joystick.<br /><br />The controller uses an Arduino nano, a regular CNC style encoder jogwheel and simple selector switches to select the axis and speed. (X, Y, Z &amp; X1, X10, X100). A regular MPG jogwheel pendant like those found on ebay will also work. Three MCP4151 10kohm VCR chips are used to interface with the main controller and mimic the X,Y and Z axis joystick inputs. The arduino controls the VCRs using the SPI serial comms protocol. This uses a two wire serial bus that connects all three chips to the Arduinos MOSI / CLK ports. The relevant chip is selected using a simple Chip Select (CS) signal connected to outputs on the Arduino. The arduino enables the relevant VCR, decodes which speed is selected and then sets the virtual potentiometers to a value that corresponds with the speed selected, for as long as the encoder is rotated.<br /><br />When the jogwheel is inactive, the VCRs are set to mid position to mimic the joystick center. If X1 is selected and the jog-wheel rotated, it will move the potentiometers virtual wiper to a position that corresponds with a small joystick movement. As the speed selector is changed, this resistance changes which mimics a larger joystick movement. Of course the movement will only be one axis at a time and only at the selected speed, although smaller movements tend to create short pulses which result in slower movement.<br /><br />There is also an adaptive output speed function, which will scale the output such that the output speed (potentiometer position) is proportional to the speed that the jog-wheel is rotated. The faster you rotate the encoder, the faster the CNC will move. Like the regular speed selects, this can be enabled by pulling the assigned input low. The adaptive speed function overrides all other speeds selected.<br /><br />The project is currently working and tested with Marlin 2.0. You can view a video of the adaptive speed function working below...<br /><br />To download the project or to contribute, please visit the projects Github page at <a href="https://github.com/DeeEmm/Marlin-CNC-Pendant">https://github.com/DeeEmm/Marlin-CNC-Pendant<br /><br /></a></p></div>

T</span><span>his allows easy comparison between items which can aid in selection and&nbsp;modification&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm a bit of a petrol-head and love to tinker with various car related projects, so a flow bench has long been on my list of tools to obtain. Such a tool would allow me to validate the modifications that I undertake on my cars and products that I am developing. Unfortunately, professional flow benches are expensive items of kit, pretty much&nbsp;way outside of the price&nbsp;range of a hobbyist like me, which has always&nbsp;excluded&nbsp;such items from my reach.&nbsp;So as with many such things, when&nbsp;I cannot afford to buy one, I figure&nbsp;I'll have&nbsp;to resort to&nbsp;making&nbsp;one instead.<br /><br />There are many DIY flow bench plans out there in the web, some good, some not so good. There are also a few different types of flow bench using&nbsp;a variety of methods to measure the flow. The traditional method is to measure the pressure differential across the item being measured and then calculate the flow. This uses a metered air supply which allows the flow value to be calculated. This is effectively how a professional bench works. Flow is metered by a range of different sized orifices, the pressure drop&nbsp;is then measured across the test item and the effective flow calculated. Traditionally such&nbsp;flow benches used manometers to measure the pressure differential, but with the advent of cheap affordable sensors, why not just use a flow meter instead?&nbsp;<br /><br />Many modern cars use a mass air-flow meter or MAF as they are commonly referred to, to measure the mass of air entering the engine. The engine management system then uses this to determine how much fuel it needs to add to create the optimum burn. So what about using&nbsp;a MAF&nbsp;to measure the amount of air passing through a cylinder head or port or whatever other test object you might want to measure. It's actually a pretty good idea.<br /><br />MAF sensors are cheap. What's more, even the cheap ones are relatively accurate. Perfect for making a cheap flow bench. Add an Arduino into the mix to take the sensor output and do some maths crunching to convert that MASS flow into VOLUMETRIC flow and you have yourself a basic, cheap and relatively accurate&nbsp;flow bench.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></span><br /></p></div>

	  <div class="es-stream-content  es-story--bg-0">Picked up the wheels today, very stoked with how they have come out. I had the rims blasted and powder-coated in satin black and then had some new tyres fitted. The wheels have been the most expensive part of the build so far, but then there are four of them and I had refurbishment costs on top of the purchase cost of the rims and tyres. I'm not entirely sure if I have ended up saving money by going down the path that I have, which was my original goal, but none-the-less, I'm very happy with the final outcome, as to me they look more 'vintage' than new or shiny wheels would have.<p>For anyone else sourcing rims, I think that the cheapest option is probably to start off by purchasing better condition rims with good usable tyres to avoid the refurb and tyre replacement costs but it might take a while to find two pairs for a reasonable price, and then there's always the risk that you are going to end up with miss-matched tyres. I could have probably shopped around and got some cheaper tyres or ordered some online and got them fitted locally, but it was convenient to use Don and such convenience has a cost. </p><p>New 17" rims with knobbly tyres are about AU$180 on ebay, but those are moto-x fronts and not postie bike rims and so have knobbly tyres and a bit more of a modern look to them. It does look like some of the fellas in the US are using these however so they are another option.</p><p>So if you're just getting into collecting parts for your build, wheels are going to be the big ticket item so it is worthwhile keeping in eye on Gumtree ads or finding someone who parts out postie bikes.</p><p>So what was the cost? Here's the final tally (excluding my machining work)</p><p>$50 - Initial purchase price (Gumtree)<br />$80 - Blasting and powder coating (Aluminium hubs were wet blasted)<br />$125 - Supply and fit tyre (including valve / rim tape + spoke repairs)</p><p>In total this has worked out at $255 per rim.</p><p>I used Associated Gritblasters in Edwardstown for the blasting and powder coating. 83741979. They came under recommendation and I was not disappointed. I'll definitely get the chassis and suspension parts done there when I'm ready. It's worth noting that they have a surcharge for EFTpos so cash is king with these fellas.</p><p>Don at DC Motorcycles sourced and fitted the tyres as well as fixed some broken spokes. He's in Marion. 83775566 										</p></div>

	  <div class="es-stream-content  es-story--bg-0">Got the front suspension kinda mounted up. I welded on the front spring hangers and made up some keeper plates for the U-Bolts. I did a bit of a test fit (even though I didn't get to finish the rear hangers) it looks pretty good and also looks like the axle line is higher than the centre of the chassis, which is great as it means that I can mount the rear axle above the chassis to help get the C of G down lower.<p>To mount the springs up I had to fabricate some eyelet bushes. I decided to make these from some rubber radiator hose and a metal spacer. It's not the most elegant of solutions, but should work okay. If I come across some urethane bar stock I'll make some new ones but I recon these will do just fine.</p><p>I need to make up some steel spacers to weld into the chassis rail to take the rear spring hanger pivot bolts. The rear spring hangers need to be bolted in relatively tightly as any play will result in the spring flopping around and a loose front axle. Given that this is 1930's technology we are playing with, it can use all of the help it can get. Handling is expected to be poor at best.</p><p>The rear spring hangers have been cut, I just need to profile the ends and drill a couple of holes, then that's it for the front suspension. </p></div>

	  <div class="es-stream-content  es-story--bg-0">Managed to get a few hours this arvo to finish off the front beam and suspension, I'm pretty happy with how it came out.<p>The leaf springs needed the leaves tying together. I think that normally they are drilled and pinned but as the springs I made are only 1" wide I decided not to drill them for fear of weakening them too much. Instead I ran a bead of weld along the outside to hold the leaves together. I then bent some flat bar around the spring to both cover the weld and hold the spring together. I think they've come out pretty good, I'm very happy with them. To finish them off I welded up the eyes on the end to give them some extra strength.</p><p>The beam and kingpin mountings that I had made previously just needed to be welded together. To do this I had to set everything out so that the kingpins had some castor angle and a little bit of camber. The caster angle is what helps the steering return to the centre and a little bit of camber helps with grip. </p><p>After laying everything out on the welding bench and setting the angles I tacked everything together before welding it up. I added some spring perches to the bottom of the beam to allow the springs to sit correctly. The width of the chassis puts the springs directly on the edge of the lower bends on the front beam, which would have made them impossible to bolt on properly. So to fix this I welded some small lengths of angle iron so that they sit parallel to the ground. This give the springs a nice flat area to mount to.</p><p>All I have to do now is make some keeper plates for the U bolts, turn down some bushes, weld the spring hanger brackets to the chassis and then I can get the beam mounted up. There's still the steering arms to sort out, but I will not be able to make those up until the rear axle is in place and the steering column has been made.  </p><p>When the front beam is mounted I will be able to see how the axle sits relative to the chassis, which will then tell me where I need to mount the rear axle. Would be good to finally get it on four wheels and rolling.</p><p>There's a bunch more photos in the gallery if you are interested in how I made the beam and leaf spring.</p><p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cyclekarts.com.au/build-pages/1-micks-cyclekart-build/albums/23-suspension-and-steering"> https://cyclekarts.com.au/build-pages/1-micks-cyclekart-build/albums/23-suspension-and-steering</a></p></div>

	  <div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>&nbsp;I've had a marine aquarium for the past 12 years. Over this time I have battled with water quality parameters and algae issues. Most of these issues have been related to poor or inadequate&nbsp;husbandry as to be frank, whilst I love my aquarium, it can be a massive time hog and I'm always very time poor.&nbsp;So just recently I've been having another crack at getting my water parameters in check and trying to keep them there</p></div>
<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="readmore"></div>
<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>My tank is a 5 footer with a heap of live rock, DSB in the sump, an el-cheapo skimmer and a power head. I've been dosing Randys 2 part for the past few years and it's probably about 6 years since I last did&nbsp;a water change. My tank params have always been on the high side for nitrates and phosphates, which has meant that I have had limited success with corals and lots of&nbsp;nuisance algae.&nbsp;But whilst I eventually gave up on keeping corals, the fish were very happy and the entire system sort of ended up in a kind of equilibrium. It's a perfect example of what a tank ends up like if you do nothing apart from replenish the basics. I ended up living with the algae, it's a bit reminiscent of my old planted tropical tank and most visitors are completely unaware that the aglae was not planted intentionally.</p><p>So about 6 months back I decided that I was going to have another go at getting things back in check and keeping some corals. I decided to go with vinegar dosing to bring down the nitrates. I followed the typical recommendations of increasing until nitrates had reduced and then halving the rate to a maintenance dose. This has now kept my nitrates steady at 0.1ppm. Great news.&nbsp;<span>The next challenge was red</span><span>ucing the phosphates.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I decided that for me I don't really want to undertake anything that requires the need for purchasing proprietary chemicals. I'm happy with Randys Two part mix (plus magnesium) as I can mix it up myself and it's dirt cheap. Plus as I mix 3&nbsp;litres at a time it's months between needing to swap the bottles on my dosing pumps. So any phosphate solution would need to follow similar principles.</p><p>Many people had good&nbsp;success with algae scrubbers or algae reactors. This kind of solution made sense to me as I figured that if algae is growing in the tank, why not grow it somewhere that I can control it. So looking at the available space I had left in the sump I decided that a DIY algae reactor was probably the go, plus if it failed to give good results I could result to running GFO. I did have some thoughts about how running vinegar dosing at the same time would affect the performance, but decided to go ahead, figuring that I could always cut back on the vinegar&nbsp;dosing if needs be. I also considered that whilst the algae and vinegar methods are competing for the same nutrients, they do so in a different manner and so could probably work side by side very well with a little tuning.&nbsp;</p><p>I looked around for a suitable reactor and decided on a Marine Sources 2.2L reactor. I also&nbsp;ordered some strip LEDs - 5 metres of water-proof&nbsp;3:1 Red:Blue, as from what I could research these were the best combination to promote growth.&nbsp; I fixed one end of the LED strip to the reactor using a cable-tie and then wrapped about half of the strip around the reactor securing the other end with another cable-tie. I plumbed the unit in with an old powerhead I had.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p></div>

	  <div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>Way back in 2013 I bought a Rumba board for my 3DR printer build. Unfortunately it had a bit if an issue with the USB chip and so the unreliable USB connectivity made it practically unusable. As far as I recall I could never even get a program loaded up, so it's been sitting in the original box that it shipped in ever since. Cue&nbsp;2019 and I've been putting together an MPCNC for a project and decided that I'd really like to get the Rumba board up and running so that I can take advantage of the six stepper drivers it has.<br /><br /></p></div>
<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="readmore"></div>
<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>Back in 2013, for whatever reason I never bothered to try and fix the issue with&nbsp;the Rumba board, and so it sat on the shelf unloved and unused. I think I managed to get as far as realising that I was not alone with Rumba USB issues as others were experiencing the same problem as me. Unfortunately, whilst there was some comraderie in shared pain, no one had any answers for me as not only was my Rumba board broken, but I also used a Mac, which meant that there was zero pooled experience to draw upon. I was on my own. And so the net result was that it probably went into the <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">too hard basket</em>&nbsp;to wait for another day.&nbsp;Well it's reprieve came this week when I decided to take a look at trying to revive it.<br /></p><p>I ordered a USBasp programming interface so that I could re-flash the firmware in the USB controller. The USB comms is handled by an&nbsp;atmega16u2, which can be re-flashed if required. The process is not super difficult but existing online tutorials do not explain things too well.<br /><br />You'll need a six pin connector for your USBasp programmer to mate with the ICSP header on the Rumba. If, like me your USBasp lead comes with a 10 pin plug you can easily make a temporary adaptor from some male / female jumper wires using the following pin outs</p><p><br /></p></div>

	  <div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>I built my Plasma CNC about 5 years ago. I had originally intended to use it to cut out component parts for a product that I make, however I found that the output quality&nbsp;was not 100% reliable and so with the cost of laser cutting being very cheap locally, it was simply not cost effective to run. So for the most part it has sat in the workshop taking up space. I've recently decided to update it to hopefully improve its reliability.<br /><br /></p></div>

	<span>THC Issues&nbsp;</span>
</h2></div>
<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>The biggest issue with the quality was the torch height control. I tried several different manufacturers of THC controller, but none were really that good. The last unit&nbsp; I bought was a proma unit, which was&nbsp;fine, but after I had some computer issues, my controller software (linux CNC) because unusable. I tried a few times to fix the corrupt files, but as I was running an older version I really needed to upgrade, which basically meant starting again.&nbsp;And so since this time, the plasma table has been used&nbsp;as a literal table, for storing boxes on top of.</p><p>At some point I had collected a DDCSV CNC controller to use on another project. This is a stand alone CNC controller that runs standard GCode and are used primarily for Milling type machines. As the plasma is a 3 axis machine, I decided that&nbsp;the DDCSV would work very well and solve my dead controller problems, the only issues is that it does not have the provision for a THC controller.</p><p>All is not lost however, as I have the proma THC unit. This unit generated outputs that went to the LinuxCNC break-out-board (BOB)&nbsp;to tell LinuxCNC when to raise or lower the torch. As mentioned, the DDCSV unit does not have any provision for torch raise or torch&nbsp;lower, so any torch height control basically needs to take place outside of the DDCSV unit. Proma do sell a unit that interfaces directly to the Z axis&nbsp;stepper controller. This unit acts as a pass-through for the stepper signals coming from the CNC controller. If the torch&nbsp;height needs to be adjusted, it hijacks the signals and sends the relevant STEP / DIR signals to&nbsp;adjust the torch height, overriding the position set by the CNC controller.</p><p>Unfortunately the proma unit I have does not work like this. Instead it controls volt-free contacts, which allow the Z+ and Z- signals to be wired to the BOB. Somehow I need to use these&nbsp;to create the relevant STEP / DIR signals. At this stage I think that an Arduino could be used to intercept the signals from the CNC controller, along with signals from the proma unit. It can then output the necessary signals to the stepper driver.</p><p>In operation, there is no need for the torch&nbsp;height to be adjusted when the arc is active. The only time that the torch height is controlled by the CNC is when it is piercing. At the moment that the arc is struck, the proma unit can take over. This means that I can use the ARCOK signal to enable / disable the proma overriding the CNC signals. A simple bit of logic is all that is required.&nbsp;Fortunately&nbsp;the stepper amplifiers and DDCSV units use 5v for the stepper signals, this is the same as the Arduino Nanos that I have.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>In theory it should work, the only reservations that I have are related to HF interference.&nbsp;</p></div>

</h2></div>
<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>To get started I need to get the DDCSV unit hooked up. This should be pretty straight forwards as essentially the stepper drivers and stepper wiring is already done. I am however taking the opportunity to re-install everything inside of the control panel that I had set aside.&nbsp;</p><p>I've stripped out the old BOB connections and made a start on putting everything onto the backplane of the control panel.&nbsp;</p><p>Next job is the get the front panel laid out and the holes cur for the controls</p></div>

	  <div class="es-stream-content  es-story--bg-0">Had a bit of time this arvo so decided to take a look at the front spindles today. The basic design uses 5/8" UNF bolts for the spindles along with 6202.2 bearings. The bolts are generally welded to some pipe or tube which pivot on a high tensile bolt or pin. Pretty basic stuff really. You can of course buy these, but as I like to make things, that's what I did.<p>I decided to make the vertical links out of 1" bright bar to fit the M12 high tensile bolts that I'm using for the king pins (plus I already had a length of this that I bought to make the rear axle from). By making them to fit I could ensure that there was minimal play in the king pin, and I could also machine them to length so that they fitted perfectly within the hangars I had previously made.</p><p>I set the length so that two thrust washers would fit above the vertical link. These washer will help reduce friction and make the steering a little easier to turn.</p><p>After stamping the hangers and vertical links with 'L' &amp; 'R' so I knew which one went where, I then cranked up the TIG and welded them up. Hopefully they are strong enough.</p><p>Next up I need to drill out the hangers for the king pins and weld some retaining tabs to the pivot bolts to retain them in position. I'll also add some grease zerks so that they can be lubricated, once I've figured out the range of movement.										</p></div>

I tried (and failed) to do it the old fashioned way with tyre levers as I don't have the strength in my arms any more. In the end I cut the bead with some bolt croppers and cut the rubber with a sharp knife. Work smarter, not harder as  they say.<p>With the tyre removed I could finally mount one of the wheels up on the lathe to check if it fitted. Fortunately there was a few mm to spare. With the wheel mounted in the chuck it was only a few minutes work to face the hub off and remove the spigot so that the hub flange I made sits nice and flat. I'm pretty happy with how it has turned out.</p><p>I still have the other hub and wheel to finish off. Then I can look at making the front hubs up</p></div>

	  <div class="es-stream-content  es-story--bg-0">Picked up some smaller flat bar to make up the leaf springs from. The local steel supplier had a bunch of 25 x 1mm offcuts in the rack so I grabbed a handful. Unfortunately they did not have spring steel in the width I needed so I ended up with mild steel, but having already experimented with the deflection of a mild steel leaf spring in my last experiment, I knew that it could be made to work.<p>Having already figured out the process, making the new springs did not take too much time at all. I modified my design a little, shortening the distance between the eyes and adding more leaves to compensate for the narrower mild steel. I also made the diameter of the eyes a little smaller so that the overall dimensions look like they are in scale.</p><p>I still need to bind the leaves together and do a little tweaking here and there, but I'm pretty happy with the results. Considering that it cost me $10 and an hour of my time, it's a win-win.</p><p>Testing out the 'springiness' (that's a technical term by the way lol) they seem to work very similar to my original test. The original spring I made was 50mm wide but only had three leaves, the new spring is 25mm wide and has six leaves. I can easily put a majority of my weight on the spring and it deflects an inch or so and then returns back to shape. </p><p>If you are interested in making one the dimensions I used are as follows:</p><p>25" - Overall length of unformed flat bar (18" eye to eye + 1" for curve + 3" for each eye)</p><p>I then made several leaves of the following dimensions - 18", 16", 14", 12" &amp; 10". </p><p>NOTE: The 18" leaves are designed to tuck in between the eyelets of the main spring.</p><p>I will probably stitch a weld along the side to hold everything together and then wrap a band around to cover the weld and make it look more like a regular leaf spring. </p><p>I measured the position of the front spindles on the car taking into account the leaf springs and axle. The spindles are approximately level with the top of the chassis rail (front axle has an 8" offset.). I expect that the finished height will likely be a bit lower when the weight is on the wheels. This means that I might just be able to mount the rear axle above the chassis rails to lower the chassis a little. Will have to see how it all fits together.<br /></p></div>

	  <div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>Last week <a href="https://deeemm.com/index.php/entry/general/diy-extruder-auger-machine-part-1" title="" class="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I wrote about the extruder screw that I'm making</a> and shared the initial build of a machine to make my own screw. In that post I created the basic table using an auger as a lead screw. This proved the concept of using an auger as the transport mechanism but when I started to build the second part, the mechanism that holds the grinder, I found that the auger was mounted&nbsp;too low in the frame&nbsp;and so&nbsp;the grinding wheel would not be able to reach the workpiece.&nbsp;So before I could get stuck into mounting the grinder I needed to move the 'lead screw' up on top of the frame.</p><p><br /></p></div>
<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="readmore"></div>
<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>Moving the lead screw&nbsp;also allowed me to change&nbsp;the design a little. After my initial tests you may recall that I decided that the nut design I had come up with was overly complex, in fact after doing some more experimenting I decided that the auger did not need to be held captive and&nbsp;enclosed within a nut at all. What I decided to do was simply run a bit of round bar over the top of the auger (I actually used a bolt as it was a little harder than round bar). The bolt is welded to the top of the slides and&nbsp;held against the top of the&nbsp;auger. The auger itself was positioned such that it engaged with the bolt with as little play as possible. Once I was happy with how everything was positioned I tacked it together and tested it out. The result is pretty good. It's not quite as smooth as the previous version with the bearings, but considering that the goal is to be able to make this with easily accessible materials and hand tools it's a win.</p><p><br /></p></div>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2019/07/21/our-war-on-plastic.html">Our war on plastic education</a></h2>
	  <p>Regular readers will remember that earlier this year I embarked on a project to help my son with a climate control school initiative, I discussed this a bit in the post on <a title="Precious Plastics" href="index.php/entry/general/precious-plastics">Precious Plastics</a>. The basic idea was that I wanted to make an extruder and shredder so that we could recycle plastic waste and create 3D printing filament that the kids could then use to print things from.</p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>From small nurdles big ideas grow</h2>
<p>Well the project has grown a little since that initial idea and has morphed into several projects that all kind of interlink. The basic project of creating 3D printed objects from waste needed a platform to allow it to be shared to other schools. So I decided that there should be a central hub that could be used as a point of reference for teachers and parents who wanted to undertake the project for their own kids / school / college / etc. Initially this will just be my sons school but if we make it future proof it will save a bunch of work down the track. So we created the website <a href="https://nurdle.org">https://nurdle.org</a> as a central hub from which the project can be shared, discussed and supported. (Nurdles are the raw plastic pellets that a majority of plastic items are made from)</p>
<p>Whilst this was going on we developed an entire framework that keyed into the various learning outcomes and provided a pathway that followed the plastics lifecycle. This allowed kids to participate in various activities relating to the project that had directly relevant learning outcomes. A big part of the activities centered on the collection, identification and segregation of plastic wastes ready for processing into recycled 3D printer filament. </p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>The TrashBin Challenge</h2>
<p>After looking at how we could make collecting plastic trash fun and educational we realised that it could be used as a tool to help raise awareness in the wider community, so we decided to package it up as a challenge that anyone could undertake. We have launched this as a stand alone thing called the 'TrashBin Challenge' - <a href="https://trashbinchallenge.org">https://trashbinchallenge.org</a> Our hope is that the challenge will be taken up by the public which will not only help raise awareness but also provide insight into domestics plastics usage. Statistical information is collected by a simple survey of plastic waste collected by participants. In turn this statistical information can be used by the kids as part of their projects. Currently the site is in pilot with test participants but feel free to go take a look</p>
<p>Here's the promo video...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><div class="legacy-video-container"><iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oP6cQ5lwGzg?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>3D Printing directly from shredded plastic</h2>
<p>The 3D printer filament machine has also morphed into something slightly different. Instead of creating filament that is then used in a regular 3D printer, we are trying to 3D print directly from shredded plastic. This is not without its own challenges and whilst it is not completely uncharted territory, it is still very much in its infancy. Our goal is to apply some engineering expertise to the process and improve the quality of the output, which is where other machines seem to fall down.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/324/b2ap3_large_IMG_7043.jpg" width="799" height="599" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>At this stage we have built a MPCNC small scale CNC machine that will be used as the basis for the 3D printer. This machine is much larger than a regular 3D printer which is necessary given that the granule extruder is physically a lot larger than the traditional filament style extruder.</p>
<p>We are also about half way through the development of the extruder. The design is complete but it requires a custom extruder screw to be manufactured. To do this we are <a title="DIY Extruder screw making machine Part 1 - The table" href="index.php/entry/general/diy-extruder-auger-machine-part-1">making a machine</a> from which we can make the extruder screw ourselves. It will also allow us to make design changes to the screw and improvements should we need to.</p>
<p>Other design issues relate to the shredder / granulator. The precious plastics shredder does not produce a small enough granule for use in our proposed extruder. This means that we are having to design our own shredder to produce granules of a suitable size. Modification of the existing Precious Plastics design did not prove to be the best pathway and a new shredder has been designed pretty much from scratch. We are also looking into a creation of a simple granulator. The granulator is probably a more appropriate type of machine for this particular application, however it is the variety of plastics which make using the granulator a challenge. If successful the granulator can be made for a fraction of the price of the shredder and can easily be scaled up for larger applications. Once the extruder has been completed this will be the next project.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Introspective</h2>
<p>So, what started off as a simple project has snowballed into something much greater. It has also caused us to take a big look at our own plastics consumption with some scrutiny. Initially from undertaking the 'Trashbin Challenge', but then later from working on ways to overcome our relentless consumption of plastics. It's a good challenge and one that with some small changes can be fairly rewarding. We are also getting our friends on board too which is really great. We have all been feeding off of each other coming up with ideas and finding places to buy stuff that isn't wrapped in plastic.  Soon, we will have the machines up and running and can finalise the educational tools too.</p>
<p>So if you are reading this, and are interested in reducing your plastics footprint, please go and take a look at the Trashbin Challenge. It's really easy to do and is a great way to get on board with helping the global plastics problem. Don't forget to get your friends involved too.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2019/07/20/diy-extruder-auger-machine-part-1.html">DIY Extruder screw making machine Part 1 - The table</a></h2>
	  <p>In my last post <a title="Improvements to a wood auger based plastics extruder" href="index.php/entry/general/improvements-to-a-wood-auger-based-plastics-extruder">Improvements to a wood auger based plastics extruder</a> I discussed an idea to make a simple machine using hand tools from which an extruder screw could be made. <span style="font-size: 12.16px;">The basic premise of the machine is that it can be built using easily obtainable parts using methods that are accessible to everyone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12.16px;">Of course, by far the best way to build an extruder screw is on a CNC machine, however this is such a specialised piece of equipment that very few people have access to one. This means that the only option to own such a screw would be to buy one already made, or engage someone to make one for them, neither of which is a cheap endeavor and in some parts of the world is simply not an option. So being able to make one from hand tools is the ideal methodology as hand tools are cheap and accessible to almost everyone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.16px;">However using hand tools to create something which needs to be relatively accurately made is not without inherent problems. The issue with hand tools is that accurate results take a lot of effort and the possibility of mistakes is also very high. For trades people and artisans accurate results are a matter of pride and are borne of experience, however for those who have little experience and have yet to develop such skills, the possibility of producing good results is somewhat reduced. </span>So the idea is that by using hand tools we can make a manufacturing aid that assists the machining of the screw. With careful design it can produce a quality in results far in excess of those used to build the machine itself</p>
<p>After doing some pondering and preliminary sketches, and getting a bit of input from the PP community, I changed the design a little. My original idea was to have the workpiece mounted next to the grinder table and coupled with timing belts, but after a suggestion of mounting it inline with the table I decided that this was a better layout as it reduces the number of parts required, which in turn reduces complexity and build time, and also improves reliability (less parts means less things to fail - machine building 101).</p>
<p>So armed with an idea and the need for a trip to the local hardware store I went and purchased the parts I needed to make the machine. </p>
<p><em>NOTE: Disclaimer: The machine design uses powered hand tools. I know that technically these are not available everywhere, but if you take into consideration that to operate the finished machine you require some form of power, using powered hand tools is fine.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong></h2>
<p>What I ended up with is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long wood auger bit</li>
<li>2 x drawer runners</li>
<li>Metal gate hinge</li>
</ul>
<p>I also had the following in stock</p>
<ul>
<li>Round (bright) bar</li>
<li>50mm steel RHS (actually an old bed frame)</li>
<li>40mm steel angle</li>
<li>50mm flat bar (I had 40mm but if you are using this a shopping list 50mm is better)</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also need the following hand tools.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drill or drill press</li>
<li>Drill bits</li>
<li>Hand held grinder - you will use this in the finished machine but can also use it to cut the metal to make the machine</li>
<li>Grinding and cutting discs</li>
<li>Files - to remove burrs and sharp edges</li>
<li>Welder.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>NOTE: It is totally possible to make this without a welder. All welded joins can be substituted for brackets and nuts and bolts or tek-screws, however using a welder makes it stronger and quicker to build.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><em><strong>How it Works</strong></em></h2>
<p>The machine is basically a table that moves when you turn a handle. <br />The table holds a grinder. <br />The handle rotates the workpiece as the table moves the grinder along it. <br />The rate at which the table moves along the workpiece and the speed of rotation of the workpiece is exactly the same as the wood auger <br />The result is that the workpiece is ground / machined as a facsimile of the auger.<br />An additional guide profile is used to set the height of the grinder <br />Varying the height of the grinder along the workpiece length changes the screws root dimension producing the load / compression / metering zones</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/323/b2ap3_large_IMG_7774.jpg" width="1000" height="750" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><em><strong>Method.</strong></em></h2>
<p>The trickiest part of the entire build is the 'nut'. This is the part that the wood auger engages into to turn the augers rotational motion into linear motion. It is effectively the same as a nut that you would use on a bolt, however it looks nothing like it. The challenge with manufacturing something that would thread onto the auger bit is that it is a very complex shape that would itself require some specialist machine, however, in practice this is not actually necessary.</p>
<p>If you turn the auger in your hand you can use your finger to follow the path of the 'thread' along the auger as it rotates. What if you replaced your finger with something more substantial, such as a metal pin? Would that not also work? It actually works quite well. Very well in fact.  So to create the 'nut' you need make a bracket that holds the pin in position against he nut as it rotates. I decided to use two pins, one above and one below the auger so that the nut could not 'skip' along the 'thread'.  These pins need to located relatively accurately, too much of a gap and the mechanism would become sloppy. </p>
<p>The first thing to find out is what size <span style="font-size: 12.16px;">pins</span> you need. These <span style="font-size: 12.16px;">pins</span> will need to be a different size depending on which size aguer you use. The easiest way to do this is to use your drills and place them into the 'thread' of the auger to find the best size. Ideally it does not want to touch the root of the thread (the innermost part). </p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img style="font-size: 12.16px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/323/b2ap3_large_IMG_7791.jpg" width="1000" height="750" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You will also want to take the very edge off of the auger bit as it will be quite sharp, you can do this with the grinder or a hand file. This will allow the mechanism to work a bit easier.</p>
<p>Once you have found out what sized <span style="font-size: 12.16px;">pins</span> you need you can use the drill to make a template to mark out the holes for the sides of the nut. Simply place the auger bit squarely onto some paper, put some ink or paint onto the end of the drill bit and then mark the paper by placing the drill bit into position in the auger. Mark both the top and the bottom of the auger. <span style="font-size: 12.16px;">Now you can use this pattern to mark out the sides of the nut. Essentially you need two holes to retain the <span style="font-size: 12.16px;">pins</span> that engage with the threads.</span></p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/323/b2ap3_large_IMG_7820.jpg" width="1000" height="750" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will confess that I decided to be a little tricky and add bearings to my machine as the <span style="font-size: 12.16px;">pins</span> rotate when the auger turns. This is something that I identified when I came up with the original design. I also turned spigots on my <span style="font-size: 12.16px;">pins</span> to fit into bearings that I already had, which is obviously moving away from the 'make it with hand tools' philosophy. My excuse here was that if I had the opportunity (and patience) I would simply have ordered bearings of a size that the <span style="font-size: 12.16px;">pins</span> fitted through without the need to machine them. But I'm impatient and I have a lathe, so I cheated. But you could also use a nut and bolt with a length of tube or something similar instead, that would negate the need for a lathe.</p>
<p>That said, in practice I don't think the bearings are actually necessary, and it did create a little bit of a problem (more on that later), but then that's what prototyping is all about. I think that the <span style="font-size: 12.16px;">pins</span> will work fine without the bearings, so do not do what I have done, instead simply make the holes the same size as the <span style="font-size: 12.16px;">pins</span> - eg if you have a 10mm <span style="font-size: 12.16px;">pins</span>, just drill 10mm holes. There will be enough clearance for the <span style="font-size: 12.16px;">pins</span> to rotate and given the speed that the <span style="font-size: 12.16px;">pins</span> rotate at, ball bearings are not actually necessary, a little oil or grease will suffice. The mechanism will be stiffer to turn, but if you are only making one or two screws, I don't think that this will be an issue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/323/b2ap3_large_IMG_7797.jpg" width="1000" height="750" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So once you have drilled out the side brackets for the nut you can then join them together. I made my nut from two pieces of angle, joined together with a bit of flat bar across the top, but it's probably better to make it from a bit of RHS with the auger running through the middle as it will be much simpler to assemble. The angle requires you clamp and align it, and in my case I welded it all together. By using RHS you simply thread the auger through the centre and then align the pins through the holes in the side. The entire assembly can then be dropped into the frame, which keeps the pins captive in the RHS.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/323/b2ap3_large_IMG_7805.jpg" width="1000" height="750" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The nut forms part of the carriage, which is mounted to two linear bearings. For this project I have used two heavy duty drawer rails. These are a primitive linear bearing which should be easily available in most places. Given that there is relatively low tool load these should work fine. </p>
<p>I modified my auger by welding a length of round bar to the end. This does two things. It provides a spigot that allows me to mount the auger between two plates, effectively turning it into a lead screw, and it also allows me to attach a coupling to it so that I can mount the workpiece.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/323/b2ap3_large_IMG_7804.jpg" width="1000" height="750" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The finished table</strong></h2>
<p>The rails mount to two lengths of RHS. these in turn are welded to some simple RHS 'feet', these feet help to keep the nut clear of the table. The auger is held at both ends by flatbar with holes to retain the auger shaft and spigot. I welded a nut hard up against the shaft end of auger to stop it moving back and forth.</p>
<p>The carriage mounts to the two drawer runners which are tacked to the top of the RHS Frame. If you are using RHS for your nut, the two side rails need to be mounted approximately 50mm apart with just enough clearance for the nut to slide along in between them without binding, but not so much that the pins can fall out. </p>
<p>I made a simple handle from aluminium with a hex hole in it, but it is easier to make a crank style handle from round bar and weld it to the end of the shaft.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/323/b2ap3_large_IMG_7807.jpg" width="1000" height="750" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here's a video of it working. The bit of bar I welded into the end of the auger needs to be straightened so ignore the wobble it has. The overall result is a fairly tight mechanism without any play</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Nut Design</strong></p>
<p>I made my nut overly complex. It would have been better to make it from a small section of RHS - basically an offcut from the body. With the nut mounted in between the side rails the nut pins would be held captive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/323/b2ap3_large_IMG_7821.jpg" width="1000" height="750" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Auger length </strong></p>
<p>The length of the finished screw is limited by the table travel, which in turn is defined by the auger length. You could theoretically make a screw twice the length of the table travel by turning it around and machining it one half at a time. My original design had the workpiece in parallel to the table, which meant that it could be indexed along, theoretically allowing you to produce a screw of infinite length. Not an issue as such, but a consideration. I also lost a bit of travel due to the design of my nut sticking out below the bottom of the side rails and hitting the 'foot'. The RHS nut above does not have this issue</p>
<p><strong>Bearings: </strong></p>
<p>If you are making one or maybe two extruder screws from this machine I think that it will be fine without bearings, but if you are planning to go into production with this machine and make a whole bunch of screws, then bearings are probably a good idea. The size of the bearings is an issue as depending on the size of your auger and therefore bar diameter you will most likely (almost certainly) find that the bearings need to fit too close to each other. This issue requires some clever thinking to be able to solve such as using smaller bearings or bushes instead of bearings or maybe staggering the bearing mounts. </p>
<p>I also peened the bearing mounts to retain them in position, this was a quick and dirty solution and not ideal. </p>
<p><strong>3D Printing &amp; Alternate Construction Techniques</strong></p>
<p>You could theoretically 3D print the nut assembly. This is not technology that is available everywhere but does potentially make creation of this device simpler. I may make a design for a 3D printed version if the actual trials are successful. </p>
<p>You could also use extruded aluminium for the frame and carriage, this would provide a simple bolt together assembly. The design is so simple that it does not really need a design.</p>
<p><strong>Workholding</strong></p>
<p>The next part is to create the tool holder, profile gauges and method of workholding.</p>
<p>Essentially the workpiece (Steel Bar) is held in line with the auger by a coupling in the space on the left of the machine.</p>
<p>All will become clear in part 2</p>
<p><strong>Automatation</strong></p>
<p>You could theoretically put a stepper motor on the end and program an Arduino to traverse the table up and down without the need to stand there and turn the handle. Equally you could also use a regular motor and limit switches to reverse the direction.</p>
<p>You could also use a stepper motor to control the depth of cut, which is an issue we are yet to encounter, but one to be considered.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2019/07/15/improvements-to-a-wood-auger-based-plastics-extruder.html">Improvements to a wood auger based plastics extruder</a></h2>
	  <p>After some <a title="https://davehakkens.nl/community/forums/topic/adding-compression-to-wood-auger/#post-145916" href="https://davehakkens.nl/community/forums/topic/adding-compression-to-wood-auger/#post-145916" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussions on the Precious Plastics forums</a> about adding compression to a wood screw auger based plastics extruder by various means, I had a bit of a eureka moment. Why modify the wood auger? Why not simply use this as a pattern to construct a brand new extruder screw of the correct characteristics?</p>
<p> </p>

<p>The biggest drawback to using a wood auger for plastics transportation in an extruder is that it does not compress the plastic. This means when you use pellets as your plastics source, the air is not compressed out of the melt, which gives you bubbles in your extrusion. This is especially true when using irregular shaped granulated recycled plastics as your feed source. To overcome this, commercial extruder screws change dimensions along the length of the screw, compressing the plastic and forcing the air out. This pressure also helps to meter the extruder output.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The discussion over on PP was based around modifying the widely and easily available wood auger bits that people use to make DIY plastics extruders from, so that they had this same change is dimensions along the length of the screw. But this got me to thinking. The pitch of the auger bit is fairly good, it works to a degree as-is, it's just the compression factor that is the issue. So with the understanding that the pitch is acceptable, why not use it as a guide to make a better auger from scratch.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So based on this idea I have come up with a concept that can be used to fairly easily and quickly make a new screw from scratch out of steel bar, using an existing auger as a template / guide. You will need to use your imagination a little, but look at the photos and I will describe my idea...</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/322/b2ap3_large_IMG_7767.jpg" width="1280" height="960" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>
<p>There is a moving table that uses the wood auger bit as it's lead screw. Onto this table an angle grinder is mounted. The grinder mount hinges at the end opposite to the grinding wheel (the handle end). This allows the grinding wheel to rise and fall. </p>
<p>The grinder assembly is supported on a bearing which runs along a cam (this is the cardboard piece in the photo but could be sheet steel). This cam is shaped to the desired profile of the root of the extruder screw. You should be able to see that my cardboard cam has a loading section, a compression section and a metering section. Changing root profile is as simple as swapping the cam.  </p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/322/b2ap3_large_IMG_7769.jpg" width="1280" height="960" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>
<p>The workpiece (represented by the steel pipe - nearest in the photo above)  is mounted between centres. Ideally a live centre in a tail stock and a chuck. The chuck is driven from the wood auger on a 1:1 ratio using a timing belt.</p>
<p>As the chuck / wood auger is turned, the table holding the grinding wheel tracks the flute of the wood auger, which then grinds the same flute pattern on to the steel stock.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/322/b2ap3_large_IMG_7768.jpg" width="1280" height="960" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>
<p>The grinder eventually grinds away the material until it reaches the cam, which prevents it from going any deeper, thus the root of the flute follows the cam profile.</p>
<p>By making the grinder have some adjustment along the axis of the workpiece, it also becomes trivial to grind the optimum 4:1 Root:Flight ratio from the auger. This can also be achieved by careful selection of grinding wheel width</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Some thoughts:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The 'nut' required to fit and follow the auger flute should not have any play. Some kind of bearing set up would be optimal. I did a quick eyeball with a 608 bearing and it should be easy enough to turn a steel 'tyre' that can be pressed onto the bearing that fits the auger flute. If you made three of these they could easily be mounted around the auger bit - a bit like a rudimentary ball screw</li>
<li>I have found that different augers (of same size but from different manufacturers) have different pitches. Which pitch is best?</li>
<li>The table motion can be inexpensively created using drawer runners, the grinder is available everywhere, same as the auger bit, the rest of it is just metal and time. This means that anyone could potentially make this device anywhere with little more than a welder and some hand tools.</li>
<li>Some parts could be 3D printed to speed up manufacture, for example the 'bearing nut' for the ball screw and the grinder holder.</li>
<li>By altering the pivot, grinder and cam follower relationship it should be possible to scale the output. Ie, you could use this machine to make a 50mm auger from a 20mm wood auger pattern. You can also do a similar thing by changing the cam profile.</li>
<li>A more elegant method of construction would be using square aluminium extrusion or even makerslide or similar.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>I think that a simple tooling fixture like this could potentially solve the issue of accessibility of manufacture for the essentially complex extruder screw. These screws generally require CNC manufacture, which is not always an option. By making a simple fixture such as this it would be possible to make an acceptable extruder screw that performs better than using an unmodified wood auger bit. It is also possible to make this from little more than scrap and without the need for a lathe or a mill, which to many is the major stumbling block.<br /><br /><br />If you use this method to make a screw, please let me know<br /><br /></p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2019/05/21/political-reform-now.html">Political reform now.</a></h2>
	  <p>Another election, another term of broken promises.</p>
<p>The two party system is broken and it is the same the world over. There is a lack of confidence in all parties, in all countries. We've had mutiny here in Australia (Gillard / Rudd) and similar issues with the UK leadership. The public in France have zero confidence in their PM and we all know how things are going in the US.</p>
<p>The recent Brexit fiasco in the UK has empirically proven that the entire political system is completely self-serving, and whilst the idea of a publicly elected representative is democratic in nature, in practice it is anything but. Regardless of your views on Brexit, it should be a wake up call to all, and not just in the UK, but anywhere that a two party system is employed. The 'us and them' philosophy serves only those in a higher power - to divide and conquer, a political philosophy that is perfectly implemented with a two party system.</p>
<p>So we are now at the point where political reform is needed. The system is broken, politicians are now no longer actually representative of the people, not that they were of course, but now we have proof. That reform is needed now. </p>
<h3>So how do we fix it? </h3>
<p>The solution is very simple...</p>
<p>The public vote directly on policy. The parties will still create policy and propose policy reform, but instead of discussing and deciding policy behind closed doors in parliament, they need to lobby the public to gain support for the policy, as it is the public that gets the final vote. In this manner any policy put forwards that does not serve the best interests of the public, or does not follow public opinion, is unlikely to get voted in.</p>
<p>The politicians can then cary on with their posturing and arguing, but on a platform that best serves the people. Not only are their arguments made under the public eye, but for a policy campaign to be successful, it will have to include all of the elements needed to sway public opinion. It will also change the political landscape to one that actually suits the core skills of the average politician, namely acting.</p>
<p>It will give a larger voice to the independents and smaller parties, and will prevent policy being rail-roaded by the larger number of parliamentary seats. </p>
<h3>Your vote, your say!</h3>
<p>It also opens up the possibility for ANYONE to promote policy to the people. Do you have something you are passionate about? maybe reform on single use plastics? Do you have a Facebook page with 100,000 followers? How about being able to put that power to actual use. Here in Australia, as with other countries, traditionally you need to collect signatures to petition parliament. Only when you have the needed minimum amount (10,000) can you submit them. If you get over 100,000 signatures it can be considered for debate in parliament, but there's no actual guarantee that it will heard, or that it will then have any effect. Especially when you petition for a reform that contravenes agenda. When you can directly canvas the voter and the voter has the ultimate power, you bypass this process and it is completely unaffected by agenda.</p>
<p>I think amazing things would happen when the power of the vote lay with the actual public. Of course it also allows mainstream media to have a large influence, but that's not really any different to how things are now. Social media also brings some balance as well. If ever there was a time that such an idea could work, it is now.</p>
<p>This is how we implement political reform. A change like this would completely change the political system and I think for the better. Of course will still need elected government to actually implement policy and take care of the day-to-day running of the country, but even this would end up reformed as a result of public policy voting being implemented. Additionally maybe the office is awarded to the party who has the best KPI's for policy success. Think about that for a second.</p>
<h3>But how do we vote?</h3>
<p>That's the easy part. We live in the age of information technology, online voting is a very easy thing to implement. And don't believe the naysayers who will tell you that it is not secure. With ID tokenisation (eg confirmation codes sent to your phone) it is almost impossible to hack. In fact banks have been using the same kind of tech for years.</p>
<p>And how do we make this happen? Well, that's the hard part. Every large scale piece of political reform in the history of the world, ever, has only come about when the people have rallied together against the current system, and not in a placard waving singing and chanting protest type manner either (that is what basically happens every election time). No, we are talking an orchestrated, simultaneous action that leaves no choice but to implement reform. A revolution, of sorts. It doesn't even need to be a physical revolution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we are all too busy being divided and conquered. Public opinion is split in the US, as it is throughout Europe. Everyone's attention is distracted from the real political game, which is happening right under peoples noses. </p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2019/04/07/south-australian-planting-guide.html">South Australian (Aquaponics) planting guide</a></h2>
	  <p>A bit of a departure from my usual tech posting, but I needed to keep this somewhere and here seemed as good a place as any (there's SOME tech involved). I'm reinstating my aquaponics setup after moving it and so found a local general planting calendar that will help me know what to plant in what month. My plan is to keep this updated with additional info as I come across it / figure it out. It's not specifically an aquaponics planting guide at the moment, but I'll notate it as the months come.</p>
<p>We've had an aquaponics setup for about 5 or 6 years and had varied success with it. Some stuff has grown very well, but other stuff that generally seems to thrive in everyone else's setup, has not done so well for us. I did put a lot of effort into things like seasonal planting, succession planting and companion planting, but it is very hard to get right, especially in such a small space. One of the issues was probably the planting guide I was using as it was not tailored for South Australia, so I've started to put together a tailored guide, as below. It's a mix of several sources; both books and web, and my plan is to notate it with information specific to aquaponics husbandry that will provide a reference for me each season.</p>

<p>Another part of the issue with my previous attempt was that whilst we had pretty good success growing from seedlings, trying to grow from seed was not as successful. Germination rates were low, plus transplanting seedlings into the grow beds also ended up with casualties. Buying seedlings, whilst more successful is obviously massively more expensive than raising from seed so I am determined to make more of a a success of things this time, although we did have great success buying seedlings from the 'death-row' section in Bunnings. <br /><br />A big part of previous failings is that whilst I love gardening, I am a complete novice when it comes to raising from seeds. This time around I've been trying to learn from my past mistakes and have been reading up a lot more. There's also heaps more info online regarding aquaponics than there was even just a few years ago, including some easy to digest youtube videos that have definitely helped. Plus I've managed to get some good advice from our local hydro shop.</p>
<p>One departure from previous is that I've invested in a decent propagation set up with a heater. If we are to be successful with succession planting we need to ensure predictable success rates so that crops can be run continuously, this is key to ensuring a continued supply. I'm also going to try using a method suggested by the local hydro shop and see how this fares.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>My Setup (for reference)</h3>
<p>My setup consists of two seperate IBCs. They are placed up against the rear wall of my garage and have steel mesh trellis mounted to the wall above them for climbers or to stake large plants. The rear wall of the garage is South facing and gets full sunlight most of the day.</p>
<p>I am also considering adding an NFT type of setup along the western wall of the garage but that's a way off at this stage.</p>
<p>At this stage (April 2019) I'm running goldfish. Basically Comets, Chubunkins and Fantails from my pond. I have previously raised Silver Perch, which I will get back to at some point, but for the time being Goldfish it is</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Guide</h3>
<p>Okay. so now on to the guide itself. There's a few things I want to try and achieve with this. </p>
<ol>
<li>Monthly planting regimen - This one's pretty easy and pretty much laid out already on a month-by-month basis, however i want to split this up further into week-by-week and extend the planting range to suit aquaponics setups</li>
<li>Succession planting volumes and times - This is a little harder but just takes some time to map out. I'm going to base my planting regime on a family of four, you may need to adjust it to suit your needs.</li>
<li>Companion planting - Again, this is going to take a little time. I did have my beds mapped out at one time, I will see if I can find the mapping and enter the information.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h3>Moon Phases</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.16px;">Now this may seem like some mumbo-jumbo but I was once told by a successful commercial farmer that planting in accordance with the moon phases is one of the keys to his success. So I am including moon phases along with the other information The moon has four basic phases, each phase or 'quarter' relates to different activities as follows:</span></p>
<p><img style="box-sizing: content-box; border: 0px; line-height: 1; vertical-align: middle;" title="New Moon on Sunday, 6 January 2019 at 11:58 am" src="https://c.tadst.com/gfx/moon3.svg" width="11" height="11" /> <strong>From New Moon (crescent moon or dark moon) to the first quarter moon -</strong><span style="color: #101213; font-family: 'Open Sans', 'Open Sans'; font-size: 16px;"> </span>The moon is waxing (growing bigger) in this phase. gravity pulls water higher, sap rises. Delay doing anything in the patch until a tiny wee fingernail of the moon is actually visible. This phase of the moon is ideal for sowing plants with edible leaves and seed heads.</p>
<p><img style="box-sizing: content-box; border: 0px; line-height: 1; vertical-align: middle;" title="First Quarter on Monday, 14 January 2019 at 5:15 pm" src="https://c.tadst.com/gfx/moon4.svg" width="11" height="11" /> <strong>From First Quarter to Second Quarter -</strong> The moon is still waxing (growing bigger) in this phase, and the sap is still flowing! Gardening is NOT recommended in the 12 hours before the full moon.  There is less gravitational pull, making this time ideal for leaf growth. Still a great phase for starting things off and even better for planting, grafting and transplanting fruiting annuals (those that produce above the ground, and have their seeds inside, like tomatoes, capsicums, beans and peas). Cereals and grains can also go in now, and it’s still okay to feed if you need.</p>
<p><img style="box-sizing: content-box; border: 0px; line-height: 1; vertical-align: middle;" title="Full Moon on Monday, 21 January 2019 at 3:46 pm" src="https://c.tadst.com/gfx/moon1.svg" width="11" height="11" /> <strong>From 12 hours after Full Moon to Third Quarter -</strong><span style="color: #101213; font-family: 'Open Sans', 'Open Sans'; font-size: 16px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12.16px;">Gardening is NOT recommended in the 12 hours before the full moon. A</span>s the moon wanes and light decreases gravitational pull returns downwards pulling water lower, making this a good time for root system growth. This phase of the moon is ideal for root crops, bulbs and transplanting. Sap is flowing downwards during this time, so whacking in bulbs and root crops that produce underground is perfect. Pruning and harvesting is recommended during this phase, but avoid planting most foliage and edible plants, as their initial growth will be impressive but will wane (just like the moon during this phase)</p>
<p><img style="box-sizing: content-box; border: 0px; line-height: 1; vertical-align: middle;" title="Third Quarter on Monday, 28 January 2019 at 7:40 am" src="https://c.tadst.com/gfx/moon2.svg" width="11" height="11" /> <strong>From Third Quarter to New Moon (dark moon) -</strong>  harvest &amp; cultivate - In the fourth quarter moonlight decreases further as does gravitational pull making this a rest time for the garden. This phase of the moon is ideal for harvesting, fertilizing, maintainence, doing those annoying jobs in the garden, the ones we put off all the time, like weeding, cultivating, pest control. It’s also the best time to mow the lawn, especially if you want to slow down the growth of the grass. Preparing patches for impending planting is a perfect project during this phase.</p>

<h3>Additional related information</h3>
<p>The following table shows the germination rate of various seedlings at different soil temperatures. The table demonstrates that there is a direct correlation between soil temperature and both the success rate and germination time. At the optimum temperature, the highest germination rate is achieved and the germination time is also the shortest.</p>
<p>The table shows that for a propagation heater set at 25 degrees you would achieve optimum germination rates for most varieties and only be slightly less successful with those varieties that require a slightly higher or a slightly lower temperature. The exceptions to this rule appear to be spinach, which requires a much colder temperature and watermelon, which requires a much higher temperature. Celery also requires a much lower temperature but as this is the food of the devil I care very little for it.</p>

	  <h3>Intro</h3>
<p>OpenWRT&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Updating OpenWRT to latest version</h3>
<p>I tried to install CNCJS under the Last version of Yun firmware available via the Dragino repository but found that it was not possible. After much trying what I discovered was that development for the YUN firmware was dropped&nbsp;in favour of the current IOT branch leaving the last version of node at 0.12.7 which was too old to install CNCJS on. I tried in vain the update node to at least version 4 but found that it simply was not possible to compile it on the earlier version of OpenWRT. So leaves the only possible pathway as upgrading the&nbsp;</p>
<p>First step update firmware to the current IOT branch, this involves two steps as trying to install the IOT image via the browser update manager will return an error. so there is an intermediate firmware that needs to be installed to negate this.</p>
<p>The YUN repositories are no longer maintained so the latest openWRT firmware now resides un the IOT branch</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dragino.com/downloads/downloads/motherboards/ms14/Firmware/">http://www.dragino.com/downloads/downloads/motherboards/ms14/Firmware/</a></p>
<p>First step is to install the intermediate firmware</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next you have to enable to firmware which has to be invoked from the command lin within the SSH terminal</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then update to IOT firmware</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>&nbsp;installing Node.js&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>On the Dragino YUN firmware node is installed by default, you can check if it is installed on your distro by issuing the check version command</p>
<p><em><strong>node -v&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same applies for npm</p>
<p><em><strong>npm -v</strong></em></p>
<p>If you do not have node.js installed on your distro you can install them via opkg</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>no nodejs included in packages for chaos_calmer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>opkg update</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>opkg install node</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we go any further...</p>
<p>These are the 'fixes' that I needed to do to enable the installation process to be successful. It's probably worth just doing these right from the get-go as it will save you a heap of time in the long run. Of course, these fixes may not be exhaustive as your particular flavour of hardware / firmware may have other gremlins that need to be addressed, but for my early Iduino Yun board this is what worked for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found that sometimes OpenWRT does not handle HTTPS very well and will give you a bunch of socket errors, if you are having issues the best option is to point the NPM package manager at the HTTP version of the registry. It will work exactly the same but does not have the overhead of establishing secure connections for each transfer / transaction. Not only does it massively reduce the risk of network issues, but the reduced overheads probably make it a bit quicker too</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, to further reduce issues with timeouts due to socket errors, it might be worth limiting the number of sockets you are using. The standard is 50. You can tweak the value but basically whilst more concurrent connections will be faster they will also chew up memory and overheads, of which neither are in great supply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>npm set maxsockets 3</p>
<p>I've found it necessary to do both of these along with the large swap to get the installation to work. You may have more luck on later processors / with larger memory but definitely on the earlier board I had, there was no chance it was going to work out of the box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also disabled IPV6 handing via the web interface for the network adaptor I was using. This was another fix for random network hangs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>network &gt; interface &gt; advanced settings&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also installed version 4 of webpack as many dependencies relay on this version&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>npm install webpack@4.x --save-dev -verbose</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other things to check are that your DNS server settings are correct, they should be passed from your cable-modem, you can view them in the web interface on the status overview page</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also make sure that your computer will not go to sleep, and that its memory does not get consumed by other processes, or that your internet connection does not get dragged down or cut off as all of these things will likely make the installation process stall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updating NPM</p>
<p>Depending on your end goal, you may need to update npm, this is the recommendation by CNCJS for running CNCJS on earlier versions of node</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;npm install npm@latest -verbose&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The issue with this is that there are a LOT of dependencies and it will take ABSOLUTELY AGES and you may well end up with incompatibilities with other packages. It is actually fR better to simply flash more up to date firmware which includes more up to date versions of everything. Or at least it would be if there was an updated firmware image available. :(&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my advice is, unless you absolutely cannot get it to work any other way - do not update NPM</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installing CNCjs</p>
<p>Now to install CNCjs itself</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We clone CNCJS from GIT and then install it locally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I absolutely recommend installing CNCJS with the verbose option checked, the installation will take ages and without verbose reporting you will have no idea is it is stuck, has crashed or is simply grinding away doing its thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The --unsafe-perm option is also necessary as on OpenWRT everything is installed and run as root.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, to install from GIT you will need to install bash or else you will not be able to run any of the installation scripts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>opkg update</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>opkg install bash</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>opkg update &amp;&amp; opkg install git</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then you can clone the repo..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>git clone git://github.com/cncjs/cncjs.git</p>
<p>cd /root/cncjs</p>
<p>git checkout master</p>
<p>npm install -verbose --unsafe-perm</p>
<p>Your terminal will now churn away for (possibly a day) so time to go do something else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have success, don't put the cuppa down just yet, there's more...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>npm run prepublish</p>
<p>If the installation fails, check the error message and try to find a fix, this can involve - manually installing dependencies / modding installation scripts / whatever else Google suggests. I found that I had a LOT of network errors, I tried various 'fixes' including those outlined above. I also disabled NPV6 via the web interface as I had read that this can cause issues. I probably tried 4 or 5 times to install, each time the installation would get a bit further before crashing. One thing to note however, is that&nbsp; every time it does manage to download a dependency it caches it locally in the npm/node_modules folder, so the next time you try to install it at least has the file cached.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2019/03/27/set-up-extroot-on-iduino-dragon-yun-shield.html">Set up EXTROOT on Iduino / Dragon YUN shield</a></h2>
	  <p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><span style="font-size: 12.16px;">The Arduino YUN shield is a shield that combines an additional stand alone processor and WIFI. It runs a cut down Linux distro</span><span style="font-size: 12.16px;"> called OpenWRT. This WIFI / OpenWRT setup is most often found in things like Wifi routers. Arduino originally combined this with a D</span><span style="font-size: 12.16px;">uemilanove on a single board to make the Arduino YUN, but the good folks at Geeetech and Dragon split the YUN interface out onto a seperate Arduino shield so that it could be used with a variety of different Arduino boards. The cool thing about these setups is that the Linux side of the package can talk to the Arduino side, which not only means that you have effectively given your Arduino WIFI capabilities but also makes it very easy to make IOT devices that need things like WIFI / Web interface / External Logging / Network Logging, well you get the idea, the list goes on. It's truly a very powerful tool.<br /></span></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><span style="font-size: 12.16px;">If you want to use the YUN to install additional programs or datalog you will need to expand the existing memory as it is woefully small. You can do this using an external USB drive</span></p>

<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><br /><br />First I decided to update the firmware to a more recent version. The Geeeetech Iduino Yun shield that I have was relatively old (Although when I bought it, it had just come out) and I could not find any firmware update files for it available from Geeetech. The Iduino seems to be based on the Dragino Yun shield, but the hardware did not appear to exactly match any of the Dragino versions. I was therefore hesitant to use any of the Dragino firmware files. The same applied to the Arduino YUN firmware. Whilst the Geeetech and Dragon Shields both use the Arduino firmware, they also implement additional code to cater for a variety of boards (the Arduino Yun is effectively an all-in-one based on the arduino duemilanove), so I decided not to try just in case i bricked the device. So my first step - upgrading the firmware to a current version, basically failed at the first hurdle. (NOTE: the arduino firmware uses different pins and is not compatible)<br /><br /></p>
<h3>Connecting to the Geeetech Iduino YUN</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">A basic overview of the iduino-YUN shield is available on the <a href="https://www.geeetech.com/wiki/index.php/Iduino_Yun_Shield#The_advantages_of_Iduino_Yun_Shield_compared_to_official_Arduino_Yun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geeetech WIKI</a> which covers initial set up and connect in more detail, but for a quick and dirty step-by-step follow these steps...</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Reset iduino by holding button for over 30 secs</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Connect to iduino ad-hoc network by wireless ( it will create a WIFI network you can connect to) </p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Now navigate to the device in your browser NOTE - Default IP address of the YUN Shield is 192.168.240.1</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Log in - the default password - iduino</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"> </p>
<h3>Updating the firmware</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><span style="font-size: 12.16px;">Next - If like me you have an older version you will need to update the firmware (Later Dragino IOT firmware will also work but there are some caveats) you can skip this step if you don't need to update.</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Go to: <a href="http://www.dragino.com/downloads/index.php?dir=motherboards/ms14/Firmware/Yun/Newest_Firmware/">http://www.dragino.com/downloads/index.php?dir=motherboards/ms14/Firmware/Yun/Newest_Firmware/</a> </p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><span style="font-size: 12.16px;">Download the relevant sysupdate file (I used </span>Version 4.1.2)</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Go to Admin interface in browser - <strong><em>System &gt; System &gt; Firmware update</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Select the file you just downloaded and update the firmware - Uncheck the box to 'keep settings'</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Once the unit has updated and rebooted it will create a different ad-hoc WIFI network (remember we've just re-flashed the firmware so our previous settings are not available)</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Join Dragino-A84041140790 wireless net (or whatever the dragino WIFI net that's just been created is called)</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">browse to <a href="http://192.168.240.1/cgi-bin/luci/webpanel/homepage">http://192.168.240.1/cgi-bin/luci/webpanel/homepage</a></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">log in - password is <strong>dragino</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"> </p>
<h3 style="font-size: 12.16px;">Configure the wireless network</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Go to<strong> <em>System &gt; Wireless parameters</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Add your local wifi details and then press '<strong><em>configure / restart</em></strong>'</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Then rejoin your local wifi net on your computer</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Now you should be able to connect to iduino by IP in your browser - you will need to check with your router what ip address has been assigned to the iduino, it will most likely be something like - <span style="font-size: 12.16px;">192.168.x.x</span> </p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">You should also now be able to connect via SSH to <span style="font-size: 12.16px;">192.168.x.x:22 </span><span style="font-size: 12.16px;">using your favourite SSH client. The username / password is: root / iduino You will need to use SSH for the following steps.</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">  </p>
<h3>Using an external USB / SD Card to increase memory.</h3>
<p>If you want to use your YUN for anything worthwhile you will likely want to install other software on it or have some room to store stuff so the first thin that you need to address is the lack of storage space. This is easily done by utilising some form of external drive.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Newer versions of the YUN shield come with an SD slot. The version I have only has a USB port. The Arduino YUNs also have an SD slot. The following should work for any board with access to either an SD or USB port as it essentially does not care where the devices are located, they are just referenced as mount points.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">First, lets see what we have to start with...</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">In your browser, go to the Iduino and navigate to System &gt; Advanced configuration &gt; System &gt; Mountpoints to view existing partitions and mount points along with space used. It will show you what existing filesystems are mounted and their sizes</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"> </p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"> </p>
<h3>Setting up the USB  </h3>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">I used a Sandisk 32gb USB 3.0 memory stick simply as it was physically the smallest I could find. You could also use an external hard drive or anything else that suited your project.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">We'll be formatting the drive and then telling the Yun to use it instead of the internal memory, which will give us heaps of space to install additional programs and save data.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Now is the time to plug it in.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"> </p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">First we need to update the packages list. Issue the following command via your SSH client</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><strong><em>opkg update</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"> </p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Next install the utilities to format in EXT4 (note these packages were appropriate for my older YUN shield, they should also work for later versions but are untested)</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><strong><em>opkg install e2fsprogs mkdosfs fdisk rsync</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"> </p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Next clear the partition table</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><strong><em>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=4096 count=10</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"> </p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Create the data partition - this is allocated 1024Meg (1 Gb) This is available to the Arduino and so must be formatted as FAT (which we will do in a sec)</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><strong><em>(echo n; echo p; echo 1; echo; echo +1024M; echo t; echo c; echo w) | fdisk /dev/sda</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"> </p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Create the swap partition (1024 Meg) NOTE: system RAM is only 64Meg so you may need to assign more swap depending on your intended use.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><strong><em>(echo n; echo p; echo 2; echo; echo +1024M; echo t; echo 2; echo 82; echo w) | fdisk /dev/sda</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"> </p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Create the linux partition (remaining space)</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><strong><em>(echo n; echo p; echo 3; echo; echo; echo w) | fdisk /dev/sda</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"> </p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Next format the data partition to FAT32</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><strong><em>mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"> </p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Format the swap partition</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><strong><em>mkswap /dev/sda2</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"> </p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">and format the linux partition to Linux EXT4</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><strong><em>mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"> </p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Now we have the relevant partitions we need to copy the existing data from the device onto the USB stick </p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">We start with creating the Arduino folder structure</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><strong><em>mkdir -p /mnt/sda1</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><strong><em>mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><strong><em>mkdir -p /mnt/sda1/arduino/www</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"> </p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">Next we copy the files from Arduino Yun flash to the USB</p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><strong><em>mkdir -p /mnt/sda3</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><strong><em>mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/sda3 </em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"><strong><em>rsync -av  --exclude=/mnt/ --exclude=/www/sd /overlay/ /mnt/sda3/</em></strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"> </p>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;"> </p>
<h3 style="font-size: 12.16px;">Setting up FSTAB</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12.16px;">So up until now we've formatted and partitioned the USB and we've copied the filesystem from the YUN into the Linux partition we created. Next we need to change which filesystem mount-points the device uses when it boots up. We want it to use our newly created USB partitions as our 'external root' or 'extroot' as it is referred to on the OpenWrt project page.  To do this the /etc/config/fstab file needs to be modified so that the appropriate mount points are used on boot. you can use the command...</p>

	  <p>I was looking at this DIY VR headset the other week - <a href="https://github.com/relativty/Relativ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/relativty/Relativ</a><br /> <br /> It uses a gyro and arduino to create controller movements on your PC so that you can map the head movements to your games and display the screen in the headset. It's not a full VR experience but would be cool as a DIY project.</p>

<p><br /> I've always been pretty keen to make a VR set up for Minecraft and have experimented with various smart phone hacks, but none have really been that good. This is mostly as I'm on a mac and so software choices are limited.<br /> <br /> When I saw the Relativ DIY headset I thought that this is a much better solution. I already have a smart phone style headset I can hack up, plenty of spare arduinos and even a low res 5" screen I could experiment with. The only part I was missing was the gyro, so I ordered some from the net.<br /> <br /> My plan is to use this setup on my sons Xbox, but I've not mapped out how to tap into the thumb-stick controls to hijack the view direction. That is until I just stumbled across ArduinoXinput - an Arduino library that allows you to communicate via USB with the Xbox controller. It basically allows you to use the I/O of arduino to trigger controller events. This means that I can create a new controller that uses the gyro for head movement but normal physical buttons for the rest of the controls.<br /> <br /> So now that I have a solution I need to get cracking and actually make it.<br /> <br /><a href="https://github.com/dmadison/ArduinoXInput" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/dmadison/ArduinoXInput</a><br /> <br /><a href="https://github.com/relativty/Relativ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/relativty/Relativ</a></p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2019/03/07/precious-plastics.html">Precious Plastics</a></h2>
	  <p>About 6 years ago I invested a bunch of time and energy into creating a 3D printing startup called Fabribles. It was basically an online web community that included a marketplace where community members could share 3D models for free or a fee. Part of the content creation included undertaking experiments with various techniques and equipment. One piece of equipment that I really wanted to build was a plastics granulator and extruder to make printer filament from recycled plastics.</p>

<p>It seemed like a logical progression for 3D printing - recycled plastics - using plastic waste created by the household to print things for use by the household, a bit of 3D printing utopia. Not only is it free but it's super good for your ego / conscience / carbonfootprint / veganmates. It's the kind of stuff that the <a href="reprap.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RepRap</a> community get all worked up over.<br /><br />Unfortunately the project ended up fizzling out as creating content was just too much work for me to do alone, so I never did get to build that extruder, but I did buy most of the parts. Those parts have been patiently sitting waiting to be used. <br /><br />Fast-forward to today (well maybe a week or so ago). I was trying to work out what project I could undertake with my Son to augment a school initiative - climate control. Then I had one of those Eureka moments !! What about recycling plastics and 3d printing something that the school could use.<br /><br />The kids could...</p>
<ul>
<li>collect the plastic (awareness for littering / recycling / waste segregation).</li>
<li>sort the plastics (awareness of plastic types).</li>
<li>wash and shred the plastics </li>
<li>create 3D printer filament</li>
<li>use the filament to print models of their own design (hopefully to help the school)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />It ticks a lot of boxes and also integrates several subjects, most of them STEM related.</p>
<p>So I decided to do a bit of a google and get some more info on what I needed to finish off the extruder and granulator. I already had a long auger bit and heating elements / temp controllers for the extruder, the casing and hopper were pretty straightforwards. And whilst I was familiar with industrial granulators I had not decided what kind of desktop design to use.<br /><br />So after googling for a while I stumbled across an initiative called <a href="https://preciousplastic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">'Precious Plastic</a>' - to recycle discarded plastic and remanufacture it into other products. These guys have taken this simple idea to the next level. They have designed and created commercial grade machines to granulate (shred) plastic, extrude and even undertake rudimentary injection molding, with impressive results too. Started by a fella called Dave Hakkens, his idea was to create easy to build modular machines that anyone could build anywhere in the world. these machines could then be used to recycle discarded plastic into useable products. They could be constructed in areas where plastic pollution was prevalent and then used to help deal with the issue by making use of the collected plastic waste.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/301/b2ap3_large_Category_products.jpg" width="1279" height="742" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>
<p>The entire project is genius really and had an instant appeal to me. Others have obviously felt the same kind of inspiration as uptake has been pretty good with over 100 installations worldwide set up and processing plastic waste into other items. Dave is now working on improvements to the existing systems and setting up new processes to further improve how plastics recycled. His vision is for these plastic processing stations to be accessible to everyone, everywhere. It's hard to convey in a few paragraphs, much better to watch this video that gives a better overview of the machines used in this process. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><div class="legacy-video-container"><iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/76AFNIxYjUE?rel=0?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once you've finished with that video it's worth looking through a few more of the videos on his channel as there's a bunch of interesting stuff going on, from how to make the machines, to techniques for actually manufacturing stuff from them. Whats more, all of the plans for the machines are available for free as they are released under an open source license. This makes it easy for anyone to set them up. In fact they have been designed with simplicity in mind. The thing I love about this is that they can be used by anyone, from surfers making cool stuff in California to people making utensils in Kenya, or even school kids making school utensils from playground waste in Adelaide.<br /><br />So I'm pretty much on board with this idea and think it's a perfect fit for the school project, in fact I think it would be a good thing to get into all schools. If kids are engaged in the process and understand the impact of plastic waste, then they are much more likely to grow into being part of the solution rather than simply adding to the problem. <br /><br />First step is building a functional shredder and extruder. The Precious Plastic shredder plans are really good, and whilst it's a little larger than the original desktop units I was looking at, it's probably a lot more practical. So I've sent the drawings out to get the parts quoted. At this stage I think I'll finish assembling the extruder that I've already started on. It's a little smaller than the Precious Plastics version, but should still function, just at a slower rate. <br /><br />I've also put a couple of websites together so that the kids can track their progress. (another tick in the STEM subjects box). I'll try and keep things updated here too.</p>

	  <p>I've been a long time supporter / user of open source EFI systems and have been playing with Speeduino for the past year or so. Speeduino is an Arduino based EFI system that uses a custom shield to provide the necessary signal processing to interface the Arduino to the engine sensors, coils and injectors allowing it to control the engine.<br /> <br /> It is also possible to use Speeduino without the injectors (ie spark-only), turning it into a well featured ignition system, which is very useful for those of us who want to run a distributor-less ignition system without paying a heap of cash.</p>

<p>I've also done similar thing in the past, using Megasquirt without the injectors to control ignition system (which is heaps cheaper than using Megajolt), however, the thing that I dislike about the Megasquirt/jolt is that it is a closed source system.<br /> <br /> So using the Speeduino as a spark-only system ticks a lot of boxes for me, however it does have one drawback. The fuel related settings are still present within Tuner Studio. Whilst this is not really a massive issue, it is a bit of an annoyance. <br /> <br /> So I decided to fork the Speeduino code and create an ignition-only version that only displays the Tuner Studio options relevant to the ignition. I've nicknamed the project 'Sparkduino' (did you see what I did there?) and you can access it on Github here &gt; https://github.com/DeeEmm/sparkduino<br /> <br /> The goal is to try and keep up to date with any ignition related improvements implemented in Speeduino and to implement some useful features that are not currently planned for release in the Speeduino code.<br /> <br /> Full details including roadmap etc can be found on the GitHub page.<br /> /DM</p>

	  <p>I previously waxed lyrical about the Sienci DIY milling machine in <a title="DIY CNC Milling machine" href="index.php/entry/general/diy-cnc-milling-machine">DIY CNC Milling machine</a>. Well since that particular post I have received pretty much all of the parts I need to build my own (improved) version.</p>
<p>The biggest diversion away from the original Sienci machine is that I have decided to use a standalone dedicated controller instead of the Arduino Uno used by the original Sienci. I have coupled this with some 3.5amp stepper drivers and some 2.8amp Nema 24 motors. Unfortunately the motors were lost in transit and the vendor refunded my my money. So having to re-order motors I managed to find a set of slightly larger Nema 24s that ran at 3.5amps (and 3.1nm) which are the maximum that I can run on the stepper drivers that I purchased. (The stepper drivers will peak at 4amp but we should be looking at working to a max duty cycle.) At any rate the larger Nema 24 motors are much bigger than the previous Nema 14s used by Sienci and offer obvious advantages when milling aluminium an other harder materials.</p>

<p>The other aspect that I modified to suit my applications was that the leadscrews used by the Sienci mill were obviously not the best solution for backlash. I decided to shell out the extra cash and buy in pre-made (but longer) ball screws. I've opted for 700mm by 500mm by 400mm on x,y and z respectively. This will give me the extra work envelop that I need.</p>
<p>At this stage I am still waiting for the new Stepper motos to arrive before I get stuck into the build. Hopefully they should be here next week.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2018/01/29/un-bricking-a-sonoff-s20.html">Un-bricking a Sonoff S20</a></h2>
	  <p>A while ago I invested in a bunch of home automation stuff to augment my Google home. I opted on the Sonoff devices as they are by far the best value and also come with Aussie compatible plugs and sockets. Unfortunately one of the units was DOA.</p>
<p>In a bid to try and resuscitate the device I decided to have a go at re-flashing the firmware with the updated Tasmota firmware. The Tasmota firmware is a third party developed firmware that adds a bunch of features to Sonoff devices, including removing some communications limitations. This last feature is one that I'm particularly interested in installing into some other 4.22mhz transmitters so that they become more usable (communications are very limited in the Ewelink app), so this initial experiment to see if the firmware upgrade works is a bit of a test. If all goes well I'll look to update my other Sonoff devices.</p>

<p>So the pathway to getting new firmware onto a Sonoff device basically involves using a C/C++ editor / compiler (I'm using an open source Arduino style IDE called Atom (you can actually use the Arduino editor if you install the relevant libraries), The platformIO Framework, a USB to serial adaptor, some flying leads and the Tasmota code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing Atom is pretty straightforwards - download it from <a href="https://atom.io">https://atom.io</a> and drag it into your applications folder (or jump through the usual hoops if you use windoze) You'll want to include the platformIO IDE extension - available from - <a href="http://platformio.org/platformio-ide">http://platformio.org/platformio-ide</a> (It's also available a pre-packaged install). PlatformIO is an IDE developed specifically for IOT devices and so includes integrated support for a wide array of embedded controllers.</li>
<li>Connecting to the device is pretty straightforwards with just Ground, VCC, TX and RX connections. The actual connection points differ from device to device but pin-outs are listed on the Tasmota WIKI - <a href="https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki">https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My device was the S20 switch, the pins are (from left to right in photo below) GND TX RX VCC</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <img src="../../../../images/blog_articles/287/b2ap3_large_IMG_3875.jpg" width="1280" height="960" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>And so I connected them up accordingly to the USB serial dongle using some jumper connections and a breadboard (as shown in the main photo).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="../../../../images/blog_articles/287/b2ap3_large_IMG_3874.jpg" width="1280" height="960" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Next up is to open the Tasmota code in the IDE. There are a few settings in platformio.ini and user_config.h that you will need to set - namely your WIFI access details and device specific details. Once these are set you can get ready to upload.</p>
<p>To be able to upload to the device you need to put it into bootloader mode - this involved holding the device button in for a few seconds whilst plugging in the USB cable to the USB-Serial converter. You won't see any flashing lights or indication that you are in bootloader mode so you'll just have to proceed to the next step and see if the file can be uploaded. To do this simply select 'Upload' from the platformIO menu. There's no need to select any ports as it will auto detect the correct USB port (or at least it did on mine).</p>
<p>Assuming everything is okay you will see the transmit and receive LEDs on the USB-Serial adaptor flashing away as it transfer the data. You will also see a progress bar appear in the IDE to let you know how far along in the process you are.</p>
<p>You will also get a 'Success' message when it is complete. You can now access your device directly via it's I address and monitor / edit settings via the web browser.</p>
<p>Cool huh!!</p>
<p>So having undertaken this on my bricked device I very easily managed to get it to live again which was an obvious win. However, when I tried to pair it to the Ewelink software I found that the device was no longer recognised. After a bit of digging and sleuth work I found out that the Tasmota software is not compatible with Ewelink. In fact it's not really compatible with any of the proprietary home automation servers. There is an emulator function for Belkin WeMo devices but I was unable to get this to work. (I have a couple of Wemo devices.) I could not get it to connect to either the wireless network or the Wemo hub. In essence my premature win has pretty much turned out to be the opposite.</p>
<p>Fortunately the vendor is sending me out a replacement S20 unit which means that ultimately this is a non-issue but it would have been nice to get the unit up and working as I'm sure I would have used it somewhere.</p>
<p>Re-flashing with standard firmware is not possible simply as the original firmware is not available, which leaves using a third party solution for the unit to talk to. This does have some advantages - For example using something like OpenHab is great as it allows for extensive customisation of rules but at this stage I need to do a fair bit more homework before deciding if this is the path that I want to take as I would hate to re-flash all of my devices only to have compatibility issues down the track. So far my (New) home automation experience has been pretty good with all devices being connected to Google Home (and also IFTTT) with no dramas whatsoever. There is a small amount of automation programmed into the system and it works great, especially with the voice activation funtionality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So before you jump into re-flashing your devices, be sure that you are aware of the limitations.</p>

I did a quick offer-up when it arrived and it looked as though it might be a bit small, so I've been keen to find out.</p>
<p>Tonight I removed the old screen and installed the new one. Unfortunately my suspicions were correct - the new screen is not tall enough and so leaves a gap at the top / bottom. The issue is simply that screen aspect ratios have changed since the P38 was a current model. The old 4:3 aspect ratio has now been superceded by 16:9, or wide screen / letterbox aspect. The result is that it is like looking at a widescreen movie on an old TV - you get a black stripe at the top and bottom of the screen - or in this case a gap.</p>

<p>I did a search to see if I could get a 6" HDMI touch screen as this would have been the perfect height, but none seem to be available, at least not for an affordable price. The touch screen membranes are available, but no 6" LCD screens. Whilst it may be possible to repurpose the original screen from the sat nav unit and retrofit a touch screen membrane over the top of it, that would mean reverse engineering the video connectors for the screen and then making / installing a VGA converter. So, it's much easier to to stick with the 5" Raspi HDMI screen and make a mask up to hide the gaps, specially as it fits perfectly in the case...</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/283/b2ap3_large_IMG_3322.jpg" width="751" height="563" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>

<p> </p>
<p>As you can see below the touch screen unit wedges nicely into the space left by the old monitor. It also leaves enough room to be able to use the USB ports on the RASPI and still retain the small circuit board used for the pushbuttons and click wheel. The circuit board also houses the LED backlights as well as a status light on the mute button and front panel. I need to spend a bit of time to decode the PCB. It looks like there should be a simple pin-out for the buttons and LEDs, this will make it easy to connect to the RASPI so this it takes its input from these buttons. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/283/b2ap3_large_IMG_3391.jpg" width="1280" height="960" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>

<p> </p>
<p>So in principle the screen fits but needs a mask to hide the gaps. It would also be good to use the existing buttons and click wheel, but the circuit board needs to be decoded and some signal conditioning might need to happen. If this is the case it might be simpler and cheaper to make up a replacement using prototype board.</p>
<p>Apart from the above, the next steps are to choose some suitable software and start programming</p>

	  <p>For a while now I've been thinking of building a small CNC mill so that I can mill aluminium stuff. For the most part I want to build it so that I can mill cylinder heads and pistons for aircooled VWs, which is another passion of mine (after software). I already have a large manual mill which replaced a small mill which I was consequently considering converting to CNC, but then stumbled across a kick-starter project called the Sienci Mill. <a href="https://sienci.com/product/sienci-mill-one-kit/">https://sienci.com/product/sienci-mill-one-kit/</a> </p>

<p>The Sienci Mill is the simplest form of mill that you can build. It probably has more in common with a 3D printer or router than a traditional mill, but then it is this simplicity that has appeal. Retrofitting a CNC control system to my small mill would require a certain amount of modification and update to the mill, for example I would need to replace the lead screws with ball screws, and overhaul the bedways and gibbs as well as make a new Z-axis and fit a different style of spindle. With building a new system from scratch I overcome many of the issues that I would otherwise need to invest time into fixing. So with this in mind, and also mind-full of the accuracy limitations of the design I decided that I wanted to build one.</p>
<p>One of the great things about projects like this is that in most cases the designers are big proponents of the open source movement and so make their designs available for others to use. The Sienci mill is no exception, which is great for people like me as it means that rather than pay and wait for one to be made and dispatched I can build my own, and maybe make some improvements as well. I know that this may sound a bit cheap of me, as after all, the Sienci mill is not exactly expensive, and these guys have invested the time and effort into it, but there is that part of me that says, 'hey I could make that', which drives me to have a go at these kind of projects. I also figure that as I release stuff back into the OS community I have a good balance between the give and take of things.</p>
<p>The standard Sienci uses a palm sized router, Nema 17 (1.5A) Stepper motors an Arduino Uno and a CNC shield with Pololu stepper drivers. The 'build' area is 235mm x 185mm x 100mm and it will happily cut aluminium to an accuracy of 0.1mm or less. This is a little small for a cylinder head, which needs about 350mm x 180mm x 130mm. It might also be a bit underpowered with the NEMA 17's as a cylinder head weighs a fair bit. So to get it to do what I need I'm going to have to 'upgrade' the design a little.</p>
<p>The first change is swapping out the 1.5A NEMA 17's for 2.8A NEMA 23s. This then creates a bit of an issue with the CNC shield as the Pololu drivers cannot handle the 2.8 amps drawn by the larger motors. I spent a bit of time trying to find a compatible driver but there is nothing in the same format as the 4898's that can be substituted to handle the extra current. This means that I need run the CNC shield driving a larger external driver like a 6600...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/281/b2ap3_large_s-l1600-12.jpg" width="609" height="609" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've previously used these on my CNC plasma and they work really well. </p>
<p>So with the motors and drivers taken care of I started to wonder if the Arduino Uno and CNC shield was the best option, after all, the CNC shield without the Pololu drivers was pretty useless, I might as well just connect the 6600's directly to the Uno. I did a bit more research to see what alternatives were available for larger drivers. My Plasma CNC runs Linux CNC on a computer with a BOB (Break Out Board) connected to the parallel port. this in turn is connected to the drives and field I/O. I considered using a similar set up as I was already familiar with it but decided that this would make the unit too cumbersome and also take away the portability that it originally had with the Uno. I did however stumble across a stand alone CNC controller that looked like it might do the job. The DDCSV1 is a 3/4 Axis CNC controller that does not need an external computer for it to work. It is a basic G/M code processor that can drive a 3 or 4 axis machine - perfect for what I want to do. The stepper drivers can connect direct, as can a spindle controller and manual shuttle controls and the best thing about it is the price. It's dirt cheap. I managed to find an interesting thread over at MadModders where they had reverse engineered the unit and improved the design. General consensus was that it was quite a capable unit.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/281/b2ap3_large_s-l1600-13.jpg" width="605" height="666" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, with the drive motors, motor drivers and the CPU unit taken care of I decided to turn my attention to the rest of the design. The standard Sienci uses an ACME style threaded rod with anti-backlash nut. I decided that if I wanted to mill aluminium 90% of the time, I might as well upgrade the transport system for something a little better. First option was ball screws. So I ordered a 400mm ball screw for the Z axis, a 500mm ball screw for the Y axis and a 750mm ball screw for the X axis which exceeds my dimensional requirements by a fair margin. I may shorten the X axis a little as a longer span on the axis' increases the potential for deflection / vibration / chatter. I will see how the design pans out. </p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/281/b2ap3_large_s-l1600-14.jpg" width="659" height="659" align="center" data-style="clear" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>At this stage that's about as far as I have got. I've received one of the ball screws but am still waiting on the rest of the parts. I'm undecided on whether I use the Sienci transport design or go for something more substantial like linear rails and bearings. Obviously linear rails would be far superior, but it would also take longer to put together and require a more substantial frame design. For the moment I have ordered some vee profile roller bearings so that I can make a similar setup to the Sienci, but I may yet change my mind.</p>
<p>Apart from ordering some buttons and knobs (and the router) that's as far as I have got. At this stage I'm planning to build the case as per the original Sienci design but upsize everything. I will most likely use two linear bearings to support the Y axis as this will provide a much more stable base platten but I think that the standard transport design will be fine for the other axis.</p>
<p>I'll post a bit more when some more parts arrive.</p>

	  <p>Traditionally I've always blogged about software related stuff here at DeeEmm.com and left blogging about my other hobbies for one of the many other sites that I have (or used to have). <br /> <br /> As time has gone on I've found that I have less time to run a multitude of sites, especially as in general none of the sites are what you would consider successful. This in part is my own doing as I have always refused to try and leverage the sites popularity to earn money from advertising, instead preferring the nice clean look of an ad-free site. And so over time, my available time to contribute to keeping sites updated had dwindled and so many of the sites have simply faded out, to be no more.</p>

<p><br /> As regular visitors would know, I have a bit of a soft spot for this particular site, and so have decided that as I don't really have anywhere to wax lyrical about some of the other things that I am into, I might as well post about them right here.<br /> <br /> I do still run a bunch of other sites, and a bunch of Facebook pages as well, which are of course the natural progression of the traditional blog site and the reason that many of my other pages have now closed, but there are quite a few hobbies that I still pursue that are no longer covered by the sites that I run.<br /> <br /> So I have decided to break with tradition and post about some of this stuff here.<br /> <br /> It's not that I am a narcissist or anything, but have always enjoyed blogging about stuff, especially if it helps others.<br /> <br /> So do not be surprised if you see some left field stuff posted here from this point onwards, it's simply just that I have decided to amalgamate my efforts and integrate everything into one single site.<br /> <br /> Watch this space...</p>

	  <p>For some reason the devs responsible for the latest OSX update have decided that the media buttons should control whatever media player last had focus. This means that they now seem to have a mind of their own and do not solely control iTunes, which is a great big PITA if you ask me.

	  <p>I always wanted the sat nav unit for my P38, but being an optional extra that wasn't originally supplied with my car I had to make do with a cubby hole instead. I did consider installing one a few times, but the cost of the unit and the fact that it is now 20 year old tech with outdated maps and bitmapped graphics just wasn't worth the effort, even if it did mean I could hack in a reversing camera. So a recent stumble across a cheap sat nav head unit whilst looking for a new drivers door lock seemed like an opportunity not to be missed. The sat nav unit is missing the box of tricks that contains the actual brains of the unit, but as I am not planning to set it up in its original configuration, that is unimportant.</p>
<p>My plans for this unit are to junk the internals and replace the screen with a small colour touch screen that interfaces to a RaspberryPi running some form of media player. I currently use my iPhone to play tunes via a bluetooth-FM adaptor. Previous to this I used the blackbox CD - iPod adaptor but now that the connectors have changed that's not an option any more. If the media player can also provide some additional functions such as Sat-Nav, Phone controls and maybe even a reversing camera, that'd be great, but they're not essential.</p>
<p>So the next steps are to wait for the unit to get here so that I can determine what size touch screen will work. Touch screens are cheap and plentiful from aliexpress just need to know what size. The touchscreen will need a HDMI input or adaptor to be able to interface with the Raspi, some also come with a dedicated composite input for a camera that is automatically selected when the input is detected. I already have a Raspi unit and from a quick google it seems like <a href="http://www.xbian.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbian</a> is a common choice for the operating software so will take a look at that too. The tricky part will be figuring out how to get it to interface with the audio system. I suspect that the easiest way to do this is to hack the black box iPod adaptor.</p>

	  <p>If, like me you are a die-hard Apple fan you have no doubt embraced all of Apples products including the sometimes not so magic, Magic Mouse. Whilst it's a great piece of design, the touch sensitive top is not for everyone (my wife hates it). It also has another annoying limitation when used with products like Autodesk's Fusion 360 - it has no middle button.</p>
<p>Not having a middle button makes navigating with Fusion 360 and absolute PITA, panning and orbiting require several clicks to enable, use and then disable the pan and orbit functions which does not make for a particularly smooth workflow, in fact it is downright annoying. Unlike Fusion 360's predecessor, 123Design, there is no orbit on the right click as this action has been replaced by a shortcut menu, there is also no keyboard shortcuts available to enable pan and orbit functions.</p>
<p>All is not lost however as there is a great little system tray app that solves this problem (and probably a few other problems that I have yet to discover). MagicPrefs is an app that extends the magic mouse's functionality by allow you to assign gestures and taps to trigger custom functions, including, yes you guessed it - a middle click. With the middle click option enabled Fusion 360 all of a sudden becomes much more usable, whats more it is absolutely free.</p>

	  <p>So many of you will be familiar with the site as a result of the plugins and modules that I used to offer. Whilst I have restored the sites main content, at this point I have not yet restored the web-store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst selling plugins and modules may seem a lucrative endeavour, the amount of resources required to develop and maintain the code is not trivial. The support request expectations for $3 plugins is often surprisingly unreasonable. The support ticket system takes a lot to maintain, especially when it is only me providing the support, and there are subscriptions to maintain, often costing orders of magnitudes more than the plugins actually bring in. All of this was okay when I had time to spare, but being relatively time poor (I work a LOT), there simply is not enough time in the day to do everything that I want to do.</p>
<p>So at this point I am not sure if I will reinstate the store. (I even toyed with the idea of not reinstating the site, but I came to the conclusion that I had too much of a soft spot for it and so it needed to live again).&nbsp;I have previously toyed with the idea of simply releasing all of the plugins for free, and this is probably the path that I will tread but for the time being I am happy to simply have the site back up and have somewhere to talk tech related garbage.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2017/03/15/joomla-nginx-php7-sef.html">Recovering InnoDB tables from database files.</a></h2>
	  <p>After a hiatus of several months the site is back up. The site was unfortunately victim to some script kiddies and fell under the scrutiny of my hosting provider. After a failed attempt to rewind to a previous backup, which turned out to be corrupt, I decided that rather than spend a bunch of time that I did not have spare trying to fix it, I would simply turn the server off and get back to it later. Of course I did not consider that 'later' may stretch to be several months but that's just the way it panned out to be.</p>
<p>So I&nbsp;finally got some free time and&nbsp;decided to take a look at getting the server&nbsp;back up and running. The original&nbsp;issue with the original server was that due to a kernal issue with the server itself, the backup service provided by my host generated corrupted backups, so reinstalling from a backup invariably led to a bricked server. I spent some time working with the host to get the server repaired and whilst I did get a server that I could SSL into&nbsp;I&nbsp;unfortunately did not get any further as the SQL service would not run due to toasted database files.</p>
<p>So with renewed enthusiasm to get the site back up the first thing I did was to create a new server instance. Might as well start afresh, especially with the kernel issue - a problem I did not want to walk back into. I then grabbed all of the database files from the original server which were located at&nbsp;<span style="color: #545454; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">/var/lib/</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #6a6a6a; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">mysql</span><span style="color: #545454; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">/"</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #6a6a6a; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">DB</span><span style="color: #545454; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">-Name"</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #545454; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-variant-ligatures: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2;">MySql is great in that you can simply physically copy the files from one database to another and the database will become available, however there are some caveats to this.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>You can then run check tables / repair tables to fix any issues, however, and rather unfortunately, this will not work on innodb tables. Bugger.</p>
<p>With my database the innodb tables were the tables that corrupted. On inspection I could see in the database folder the tables were present by not in the same format as the normal tables. Normally you will find three files for each table -&nbsp;table.frm table.MYD and table.MYI. In the case of innodb tables there were only two files - table.frm and table.IBD.</p>
<p>It is easy enough to generate an insert statement from the FRM file which will allow you to recreate the table structure, but to recover the contents requires a little messing about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To recover the table structure</strong></p>
<p><code>install mysqlfrm</code></p>
<p>CD into the database directory and then run the following statement</p>
<p><code>mysqlfrm --server=username:password@localhost --port=3307 yourtablename.frm &gt; yourtablename.txt</code></p>
<p>This will create a text file with the SQL to create the table.</p>
<p>However - Before you run the SQL code you will need to do the following...</p>
<p>Rename the <em>yourtablename.ibd</em> file to&nbsp;<em>yourtablename.ibd.old</em></p>
<p>Delete the <em>yourtablename.frm</em> file</p>
<p>Then you can run the SQL statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To recover the table contents</strong></p>
<p>Once the table structure has been created you will note that you now have two new files in the database folder</p>
<p><em>yourtablename.frm</em></p>
<p><em>yourtablename.ibd</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To recover the data you need to discard the exisitng ibd file and replace it with the old one. You can do this as follows:</p>
<p>Run the following SQL statement</p>
<p><code>ALTER TABLE yourtablename DISCARD TABLESPACE;</code></p>
<p>This will discard the new ibd file. You will note it is no longer in the folder</p>
<p>Rename the original <em>yourtablename.ibd.old</em> file to&nbsp;<em>yourtablename.ibd</em></p>
<p>Then run the following SQL</p>
<p><code>ALTER TABLE yourtablename IMPORT TABLESPACE;</code></p>
<p>This will bring the contents into the database. Browse to the table using phpmyadmin and check.</p>
<p>Repeat&nbsp;for the other tables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will work 90% of the time, however there are some occasions where an error will be thrown and the tablespace will not be imported. For me it allowed me to recover enough information to be able to recreate the site. Fortunately the tables that contained the main content were able to be saved, the tables that I had an issue with were able to be simply recreated with the new installation, of course your mileage may vary.</p>

<p><span style="color: #1d2129; font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, system-ui, '.SFNSText-Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">I like that this opens up the potential for WiFi access with an integrated onboard web-server. This is the perfect combination for the Fabribot 3D printer that I am developing where browser based printer control is something that I would like to achieve. Imagine: Just open up your browser, navigate to your printers IP address. Upload a file and print. </span><span style="color: #1d2129; font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, system-ui, '.SFNSText-Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">There's even the possibility of integrating onboard slicing - where you can send the printer an STL instead of G-Code. It's all pretty easy to achieve with a Linux based controller and a simple web interface.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d2129; font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, system-ui, '.SFNSText-Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">From what I understand there's a communications abstraction layer between the Arduino and RasPi aspects of the system, both of which also operate independently. This communications layer allows you to access Arduino I/O &amp; variables from within the Linux core and vice versa. The actual details are a little unclear but for adding a simple web interface to an Arduino an leveraging the power of linux to take care of file handing it seems to have all that is required.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d2129; font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, system-ui, '.SFNSText-Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">I'm pretty excited about this. Guess now I need to get my game together and finish off the Fabribot</span></p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2015/09/03/recycling-plastic-into-3d-prints.html">Recycling plastic into 3D prints</a></h2>
	  <p>I've been thinking of making a shredder and extruder to recycle plastics for use in my 3D printer. </p>
<p>I've found some pretty cool projects out there and it doesn't look too hard to put together, a bit of CAD work and laser cutting for the shredder and maybe a bit of turning to make an extruder but even that's probably not necessary.<br /><br />Marcus Thymarks Filamaker is probably the best example - <a id="js_1lcs" href="https://www.facebook.com/FilaMaker/?hc_location=ufi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=300286680075733">https://www.facebook.com/FilaMaker</a> and there's a few on the RepRap site. Marcus's shredder is basically a scaled down version of an industrial shredder coupled with an extruder which allows you to make filament from granules and shred failed prints to be reused.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="../../../../images/blog_articles/307/b2ap3_large_354763_original.jpg" width="700" height="394" align="center" data-style="clear" /><br />I'm pretty sure that the extruders all use some form of auger bit to push the plastic through a hot-end - basically a modified wood auger running in a steel pipe with a heating element and nozzle at one end. This is not too dissimilar to an industrial plastic extruder like you would find on an injection moulding machine. Pretty agricultural really.</p>
<p>Best part is that you can make your own filament from pellets which are about a fifth of the cost of buying filament on the roll or you can use chopped up recycled plastic which is potentially free. If you are using pellets you can mix colours to make multi-coloured filament which gives some pretty cool effects. </p>
<p>Here's another related project the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Omnidynamics?fref=nf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strooder</a>. The Strooder is a desktop filament making machine that makes filament from raw pellets. I'm not sure if it can handle irregular shaped pellets (recycled material) but it's a nice concept.</p>
<p>There are also a few people experimenting with pellet style extruders mounted directly to their printers, a concept I really like but probably doesn't work too well on a delta style printer. There's some <a href="https://reprap.org/forum/read.php?171,40341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">good information</a> on the RepRap site relating to granule extruders worth checking out, as well as a bunch of links worth checking out in the <a href="https://reprap.org/wiki/Granule_Extruder_Team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RepRap Wiki</a> but by far the most progress seems to have currently been undertaken by RichRap with his working <a href="https://richrap.blogspot.com/2014/12/no-more-filament-quest-for-universal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pellet extruder</a>. Regular readers may recall that I built RichRaps 3DR delta printer, and having first hand experience with RichRaps designs I can only assume that his extruder will work just as well.<br /><br />I've been saving my failed prints for a while (I've got a few <span title="grin emoticon">:D</span> ) and also taking note of the recycle markings on various plastic packaging which tells you what kind of material it is, there's a whole bunch of opportunity out there. It just needs a reliable way to turn this waste into 3D prints.</p>

	  <p>I've been a proponent of Mac and OSX for some time now having been attracted to its simplicity and the 'it just works' way that it operates but since the Mavericks update some things simply don't work. The biggest issue that I have found is that apples newly written USB drivers will not connect to my Arduino, a major PITA when it comes to uploading a new program. The solution is to <a href="http://www.enttec.com/support-center/kb/article/108-OS_X_Mavericks_%2810.9%29_-_IMPORTANT" target="_blank">disable the OSX drivers</a> and <a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm" target="_blank">install the OEM version</a> which worked for me and seems to work in 95% of cases. Why Apple have decided to move away from the chipsets manufacturers drivers I will never know although I suspect that it may be due to an incompatibility that causes Kernel Panics as I have personally experienced these since moving to the OEM drivers. This is fairly repeatable - hold down the Arduino reset button whilst uploading the program and your machine will likely go into an involuntary and instant reboot. The solution is of course simply not to hold down the reset button but as this is a common hack to get the program to upload you may have to suffer a few missed uploads instead. Not a massive issue, at least I can now communicate with the arduino again.</p>
<p>The most recent issue to hit me as a potential result of Mavericks is that sent email messages seem to disappear into the ether instead of appearing in the sent box as they should. This issue only recently came to light when I needed to find some previous correspondence. For reliability and ease of management I use a hosted exchange server to handle my work emails and OSX Mail as my mail client. What I found was that the last sent message in my sent folder was dated December 2013, the previous correspondence I was looking for was nowhere to be seen. I also checked the exchange OWA browser client but after looking there I also found that there were no recent sent mail messages stored.</p>
<p>After a short call with the exchange tech who advised me to use a client that they supported - namely outlook 2010 - he advised that the issue appeared to be related to the Mavericks update. For some reason the outgoing server had been changed - there were now two exchange outgoing servers in the server list. I changed the outgoing server to the other exchange server listed and sent a test message. Viola! the message was saved in the sent messages folder.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why or how the second outgoing server was added, It's definitely nothing that I have consciously done as the exchange account has not been altered since it was setup in 2010, additionally no one else uses this machine. I can only assume that as the tech&nbsp; suggested it is related to the mavericks update as the last email date roughly coincides with the date that I updated. Of course I am happy to concede that it could be due to some other unrelated reason but knowing that I did not create the second outgoing server makes me wonder how it got there.</p>

	  <p>Ive used Paul Irish's excellent <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDYQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.infinite-scroll.com%2F&amp;ei=8roEU-6YK8O1tAbzl4DwBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGM_yMGsAHVr_SAoWKUWlBrEwQu2g&amp;sig2=2n7MUQDPvwzLNeWQWzeNBw&amp;bvm=bv.61535280,d.Yms" target="_blank">infinte scroll</a> on a number of projects before but recently found that I was having issues with ending the scrolling after the last items was retrieved on Hikashop. The issue is due to Joomla's error handling - instead of&nbsp; returning a 404 'page not found' error response it returns a normal page ok response (200) - it can do this intentionally when it provides a useful user defined 404 error page but can also do this unintentionally as in this case. This behavior is commonly known as a soft 404.</p>
<p>As infinite scroll relies on a 404 error being returned when there are no more pages to stop further processing, the net result is that the scrolling keeps on going. Not a massive issue but one that results in an annoying animated icon appearing when you scroll past the end of the page.</p>
<p>In my opinion this is not necessarily the best way of detecting the 'end of the internets' as it assumes that the 404 error means there are no more pages. I'm sure we all know what assumptions usually lead to. By far the best way to determine if there is no more data is to check the actual data itself.</p>
<p>I initially tried looking at the length of the data returned but found that this was not really suitable as it contained the entire page and was really hard to separate the parts that I required although this is possibly due to my lack of javascript skills more than anything else. After some testing I found that instead of looking at the data length looking at the length of the child elements returned was the way to go. I this way I could detect when no more data was present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do this I created an additional option and set it to accumulate the length of itemselector child data returned using $('.itemSelectorChildClass').length I then checked this each time that the information was retrieved to see if it's length had increased. If there was no change then no new data had been retrieved so I destroyed the instance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I my opinion a much better way than relying on a 404 as this works regardless of the returned page state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is however one caveat to this solution; On the page I was returning there was reliable repeatable child data that I could test for. This may not be the case for all pages and may require that you wrap your data in a further block element so that you can implement this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EG</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="itemSelector"&gt;
    &lt;div class="itemSelectorChild"&gt;
        Lorem ipsum...
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To implement this an additional two options need to be added:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre><code>$.infinitescroll.defaults = {
    //...other options
    state: { 
    //...other state options..
        numSubItems: 0 // variable to count total child items returned
    }
    //...other options
    itemSelectorChild: ".itemSelectorChildClass" // class of itemselector child
}
</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following code then needs to be added to the end of the _retrieve function</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre><code>//test for increase in number of child items
if (opts.numSubItems === $(opts.itemSelectorChild).length) {
    //no more child items added so lets be done
    state.isDone = true;
    //do end tasks here 
}

//more child items added so update count
opts.numSubItems = $(opts.itemSelectorChild).length;                   
</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone else out.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2014/01/31/software-reputation-and-virtuemart.html">Software, reputation and Virtuemart</a></h2>
	  <p>It's been a while now since I last posted about my experience with <a href="blog/entry/general/virtuemart-revisited">VirtueMart</a>, but a recent update caused me to have several <a href="blog/entry/latest-news/virtuemart-paypal-checkout-issues">issues with the PayPal payment gateway.</a></p>
<p>The recent official 2.0.26x releases included an 'improvement' to the PayPal payment gateway, an update that unfortunately was not sufficiently tested and resulted in normally successful PayPal transactions not being completed but being marked as pending instead. The issue relates to a check that was introduced for the merchant email address.</p>
<p>My investigations unearthed the<a href="http://forum.virtuemart.net/index.php?topic=120985.30"> root cause of the problem</a> - a check that compares the merchant email against the paypal receiver email.</p>
<pre class="brush:php">$paypal_data['receiver_email']!=$this-&gt;merchant_email
</pre>
<p>The problem arises when your PayPal account has several registered email addresses, the business email response returns the primary email that is registered with PayPal, if like me, you use several email addresses for several sites on the same PayPal account you will find that invariably the business address will differ from the email address stored as the merchant email address in the VirtueMart payment plugin and the transaction will appear to fail. </p>
<p>What actually happens is that if this check fails the transaction is not changed from pending to complete - the actual PayPal payment has already successfully taken place so it's too late to do anything to affect the transfer of money. To me this is a bit like closing the gate after the horse has bolted - too little - too late. It makes no sense to perform this check at that time in the transaction. Your customer has already parted with their hard earned cash but cannot download their goods until you manually go in and change the status of the order in the backend admin panel. This results in either the customer cancelling the payment and filing for non-receipt with PayPal, or a barrage of angry support requests demanding their goods. Might as well go back to the olden days of sending cheques by mail.</p>
<p>The solution given to me was equally non-sensical and was actually specifically tailored to address my error message (AFAIK there can be two outcomes depending on whether you are using the primary PayPal email address as your merchant email address)</p>
<pre class="brush:php">strcasecmp($paypal_data['business'],$this-&gt;merchant_email)!=0 )
</pre>
<p>I cannot really see the need for this check, why check that the email you sent the payment to is the email that PayPal actually used??? There is really no need to verify the functionality of PayPals API, if they cannot get it right, there really is absolutely no hope for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Apart from the nonsensical code, the thing that really surprised me was that this issue had been unaddressed for well over a month. This issue was originally reported at the beginning of December, an issue in the primary payment gateway of a product that calls itself 'The Future of eCommerce'.</p>
<p>PHAH!</p>
<p>I was actually very very very (did I say very) surprised that such an issue should have even made it into a production release. This was not even a major release - just a minor release, well in fact it was not even a minor revision release as the versioning numbering has letters tacked onto the end of it - not really sure what that signifies but it's definitely not following a standard major | minor | revision numbering scheme.</p>
<p>Test test test - that's the mantra of all software developers the world over. I have often said that developers that are as flippant as this would not last 5 minutes in the real world. A world where simple mistakes such as this cost money and reputation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I decided to <a href="http://forum.virtuemart.net/index.php?topic=120985.msg416036#msg416036">air my disappointment</a> on their support forums which was met by a rather personal response that accused me of being brainless and less polite than a dog . This tickled me quite a lot, especially when taken in context with the recent issues I have been having with dog owners using my front lawn to empty their dogs - owners who appear to be both brainless and impolite.</p>
<p>Of course, such a rebuke was partially deserved, especially as it appeared to be from a sensitive teenager. (Teenagers are of course known for their angst.)</p>
<p>One point said teen raised was that...</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">they are fixing all this stuff for free.
</pre>
<p>Which led me back to my <a href="blog/entry/general/virtuemart-revisited">earlier article on Virtuemart</a> which highlighted that the now absent download feature from VM1 that had been replaced by an overpriced, under featured extension in VM2. The 'we're fixing all this for free' excuse was exactly the same standpoint given back then, and here it is regurgitated and repeated by another forum member like some kind of mantra.</p>
<p>I was even more surprised when the dev who was dealing with my query accused my response as being aggressive and asked me to cool down. WTF?! Ahh well whatever.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it seems to me that Virtuemart have really lost the plot. Instead of trying to actually become 'The Future of eCommerce' it seems that they have lost sight of the goal. Rather than fixing major (fundamental) issues in their code and issuing a bugfix release, they just leave them in there until the next normal release on the release cycle. This is especially annoying when you consider that Joomla comes with an automatic update feature, that makes it simple to make such updates. Given that this bug is well over a month old I personally think that Virtuemart should really have done something about it.</p>
<p>There is a lot of trust placed in VirtueMart by their users, not only do it's users rely on Virtuemart to handle financial transactions without issue, (transactions that I might add can range in value from anything from a few dollars to several thousands of dollars), they also rely on the integrity of the developers to ensure that mistakes like this simply do not make it into a production release. Mistakes like this cost the end user money and when you are trying to run a business, failed sales and transactions cancelled by users unable to download their purchases is not good for the bottom line not to mention the extra strain on your support system.</p>
<p>In the world of financial software, just like in the world of industrial software and automation in which I work, there is zero room for error. Such flippancy on behalf of the developer ends up costing the end user money and if there is one thing that I know from running my own business; the quickest way to piss someone off is to affect their bank balance.</p>
<p>What VirtueMart really need to realise is that whilst they may consider that they operate under the banner of free and open source software, and that this in some way affords them some kind of perceived respite in their endeavors, the reality is that they operate within a field where their product performance is judged the same as every other product in the market; a product that people rely upon to run their business with, that people entrust to handle financial transactions on their behalf and that people expect to deliver what is promised. VirtueMart is a mature product, which means that there are certain expectations and qualities to uphold. The price has nothing to do with the expected quality, especially when the product is being advertised as 'The Future of eCommerce'.</p>
<p>There are a couple of products that I have come across in my travels that follow this philosophy of 'you cannot complain because we do this for free', and in both cases when you compare them against the competition it is clear to see that this attitude only serves to hold the product back. Constructive criticism is a very important part of customer feedback. Generally the level of irateness expressed is a good barometer for how large the problem is and such feedback should be considered an important part of the development lifecycle, after all, these are your customers.</p>
<p>Up until I experienced these recent PayPal issues I was still using VirtueMart here on deeemm.com. I long ago switched to HikaShop for my other commercial sites. It is a much better product, with much better support. Download functionality is part of the core, as is a bunch of other stuff that you need to pay extra for in VirtueMart. However. PayPal issues, angry teens, missing features and poor support aside there is actually a much more compelling reason NOT to use VirtueMart.</p>
<p>It does not support Joomla 3.</p>
<p>Joomla 3 is now the defacto Joomla version to use. It is recommended by Joomla as the version to use of you are creating a site and whilst Joomla recommend existing Joomla 2 users to stick with it until the release of Joomla 3.5, Joomla 3 is officially the current stable version. It's also been the current stable version for some time now. So it's <a href="http://forum.virtuemart.net/index.php?topic=111946.0">quite surprising to learn</a> that despite countless questions by VirtueMart users the official line (expressed in a particularly passive-aggressive manner by aforementioned angst ridden teen) is that they are not even going to start looking at Joomla 3 compatibility until 3.5 has been released.</p>
<p>And that right there is the clincher for me and the reason that I have just updated this site to Joomla 3 and HikaShop.</p>
<p>If you are just about to embark on putting an online shop together I seriously recommend that you take a look into using Joomla 3 and HikaShop. If you currently use a Virtuemart store for your business, I would recommend that you seriously consider your position with regards to financial risk. All you really need to ask yourself is whether VirtueMart gives you that warm fuzzy confidence that you would expect from a product labelled as 'The Future of eCommerce'. In my case it was a resounding NO.</p>

	  <p>Over the past couple of days I have had a number of PayPal payment gateway issues. This has resulted in a number of transactions not being completed even though the PayPal transaction was successful.Transactions were stuck in the 'pending' mode and several customers complained that their purchases were not available for download.</p>
<p>You will be pleased to hear that the issue has now been traced to the recent Virtuemart update that was released. A change was added to this release to ensure that only the primary PayPal email was used for checkout. This resulted in a checkout failure if any other email address was used. If like me you have several email addresses associated with your PayPal account you will likely suffer similar issues and will be interested in downloading Virtuemart bugfix version 2.0.26d:</p>
<p>You can download the updated version 2.0.26d from http://dev.virtuemart.net/projects/virtuemart/files </p>
<p>Apologies to those who were unable to download their purchases straight away. If any new customers experience any issues please comment below and let me know and I will jump right onto it.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2014/01/15/configuring-joomla-to-use-zoho-mail-with-msmtp-on-ubuntu.html">Configuring Joomla to use Zoho mail with MSMTP on Ubuntu.</a></h2>
	  <p>A while ago I switched to using zohomail for the email handling on a number of sites that I run. Zohomail is a nice alternative to hotmail or gmail and is also free for a limited number of users which makes it perfect when you just need to add a contact method to a website or just need something to process user messages.</p>
<p>I had previously been running zohomail under the SMTP service on my Joomla installs as I do not have sendmail installed. I find that it's simply too much to maintain and that SMTP is much simpler. Unfortunately for some reason whilst updating one of my sites the SMTP function simply stopped working and no amount of googling could give me an answer. So unperturbed I decided to engineer an alternative to the native Joomla SMTP functionality. After a bit of research and stumbling across Emanuel Tessores <a href="http://www.emanueletessore.com/how-to-configure-msmtp-as-a-gmail-relay-on-ubuntu-server/" target="_blank">excellent article</a> I decided to give <a href="http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">MSMTP</a> a shot</p>
<p>MSMTP is a very simple and easy to use smtp client with excellent <span class="extiw">sendmail</span> compatibility. It can be used to in place of sendmail to allow you to send emails via a third party SMTP server such as zoho, gmail or hotmail. Installation and setup is relatively straightforward being installable via apt-get via the following command</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install msmtp
</pre>
<p>Once installed you need to create two files; a configuration file for the email server details that you wish to connect to and a log file to record each mail transaction. You can do this by using the commands below</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">sudo mkdir /etc/msmtp
sudo mkdir /var/log/msmtp
</pre>
<p>Next you need to create the config file</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">sudo touch /etc/msmtp/yourservername
sudo nano /etc/msmtp/yourservername
</pre>
<p>With the config file opened in nano you need to add the following information - (simply cut and paste it in.)</p>
<pre class="brush:plain"># Define here some setting that can be useful for every account
defaults
        logfile /var/log/msmtp/general.log

# Settings for default account
account default
        protocol smtp
        host smtp.zoho.com
        tls on
        tls_starttls off
        tls_certcheck off
        port 465
        auth plain
        user username[A]yourdomain.com
        password yourpassword
        from username[A]yourdomain.com
        logfile /var/log/msmtp/yourservername.log

# If you don't use any "-a" parameter in your command line,
# the default account "default" will be used.
account default: default

</pre>
<p>Obviously you need to substitute the relevant account details for those of your own email account.</p>
<p>One point to note is that to be able to use the email account it will have to be configured as a 'send mail' address. This can be done by logging in to the zoho webmail client and going to &gt; settings &gt; mail &gt; send mail as and then adding the email address you wish to use. You will also need to confirm ownership of the email by pasting in a confirmation code emailed out to the email address.</p>
<p>With the configuration file finished save it and then run the following command to change it's permissions. If you don't do this MSMTP will not work.</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">sudo chmod 600 -R /etc/msmtp/yourservername 
</pre>
<p>Now that the email address and MSMTP are configured it's time to test. This is easy enough to do from the command line but first you will need to temporarily change the file ownership of the config and log files to allow you to run them. This is very easily done as follows</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">sudo chown -R yourusername:yourusername /var/log/msmtp 
sudo chown -R yourusername:yourusername /etc/msmtp/
</pre>
<p>(Replace yourusername with the username you used to log into your server with) Now lets send a test message:</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">sudo echo -e "Subject: Test Mail\r\n\r\nThis is a test mail" | msmtp --debug --from=sender[A]yourdomain.com -t receipient[A]thierdomain.com --file=/etc/msmtp/yourservername
</pre>
<p>Again, note the parts to be changed. It is important that the from address is exactly the same as the one you specified in the configuration file and set up as the 'send mail' address, if there is a discrepancy here it will likely result in a 553 Relaying disallowed response from the server.</p>
<p>When you hit return you should be able to see the entire transaction scroll up on the terminal screen, if everything is okay you will get a 250 Message received response at the end. If you get any other response you will need to note the error and address it accordingly.</p>
<p><br />With the email now set up to work from the command line it's now time to switch out the sendmail function to use MSMTP instead. To do this you will need to edit your php.ini file. this should reside at&nbsp; /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini you can check this viewing the php info print out under &gt; system information &gt; php information in the administration panel. Open up php.ini in nano by using the following command.<br /><br /></p>
<pre class="brush:plain">sudo nano /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
</pre>
<p>Locate or search for the following</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">sendmail_path =
</pre>
<p>Depending on your server configuration it may or may not be empty. You need to change it to the following:</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">sendmail_path = "/usr/bin/msmtp -C /etc/msmtp/yourservername --logfile /var/log/msmtp/yourservername.log -a default -t"
</pre>
<p>Again - replace the relevant details with those of your own and save your changes. be sure to restart your server afterwards.</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">sudo service apache2 restart
</pre>
<p>Finally you need to reverse those permissions you set earlier by issuing following commands...</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/log/msmtp 
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /etc/msmtp/
</pre>
<p>...and also checking that you have the Joomla mail settings set to use the php mail function NOT sendmail or SMTP. You can set this in &gt; system &gt; global configuration &gt; server &gt; mail settings.</p>
<p>Great, now for some more testing.</p>
<p>I tested my setup by filling out and submitting a contact form but you could also use the mess message feature (limit the number of messages by only sending it to a user groups with one or two members) - if everything is okay you should see a 'message is sent' message.</p>
<p>Whilst this is not a straightforward solution it does completely do away with sendmail which is not trivial to setup and manage. It also allows you to use any SMTP server you want, I used zohomail but you could easily use your&nbsp; ISPs SMTP server or googlemail, yahoomail etc. (a google will turn up results that contain the relevant SMTP settings for gmail / yahoo mail / hotmail)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of caveats....&nbsp;</p>
<p>1: You need to ensure that you have the correct MX records set up for your domain for your zohomail account to work correctly with your domain. These are as follows:</p>
<pre class="brush:plain">10 mx.zohomail.com
20 mx2.zohomail.com
</pre>
<p>(This does not apply if you are using an @zohomail.com email address.)</p>
<p>I recommend making sure everything works with your regular email client before jumping into this. It might save some headaches later</p>
<p>2: For some reason the code highlighter has gone nuts and will not let me post the @ sign in the code snippets so I have replaced these with [A] but I'm guessing that you probably realized that already ;)</p>

	  <p><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Inspired by the recent receipt of my hot end I decided that it really was time I strung up the spectra line and got the printer a little more finished. Well it's finally finished and up and running. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">After running some test prints there' few issues I need to address...</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">The first thing I need to 'fix' was my hobbed bolt. There were definite repeating patterns in the layers that seemed to correspond with the rotation of the extruder. I marked the extruder wheel and then watched the pattern repeat as the wheel rotated a full revolution. The pattern was little more then visible difference in the 'transparency' of the filament as it printed but I wanted to be sure to eliminate all issues, after all print quality is the name of the game.</span><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">My previous attempt at making the hobbed bolt was a very Heath Robinnson affair. I did not use a 3D printed guide but instead used a couple of 608 bearings in the vice along with my hand held battery drill. Whilst it did look quite good I will accept the possibility that it could be to blame for my poor print quality. So wanting to get things right this time around I decided to download a suitable 3D printed tool to assist.</span><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Most of the hobbed bolt tools that I had seen simply consisted of a square block with two holes through it at right angles - one for the bolt and one for the tap. (the serrated groove is made with a 6mm tap). The blocks have recesses for bearings - 608s in the case of the bolt and a 624 for the tap. There are also some that use a dremel with a cut off wheel and a mini dividing head type of arrangement to cut gives around the circumference of the bolt. Neither really appealed to me. I had no 624 bearings and the slots made with the dremel seemed very course.</span><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">In the end I found a tool to use with a lathe. It looks a bit like a knurling tool except that it holds the bolt in two 608 bearings and the tap fits into the chuck. The best part was that I did not need the small bearing. I downloaded it and printed it out (good job I've got the makerbot here at the moment). If you want to download it yourself it is </span><a class="bbcode_url" style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; outline: none !important;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160805222314/http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3780/#files" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">thing 3780</a></p>
<p><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Most of the tutorials that I have seen and the info that I found recommend to use an M6 tap. I used this for the first bolt but then got to thinking about the diameter of the groove in relation to the filament size and decided to make an M4 bolt too. Making the hobbed bolt is simply a case of mounting the bolt holder in the tool post and the tap into the chuck. I then set the lathe to the slowest speed and slowly set the bolt to the tap using the cross slide. The bolt slowly spins as the tap acts like a worm drive; cutting the serrations as it turns. I let the bolt rotate a few times before finishing it. The important thing here is to make sure that you cut the groove at the right height I did this by putting the bolt into the extruder and marking it with a marker pen. You can then set the bolt correctly by shimming it with washers.</span><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">With the new bolt made I set everything up and tested the extruder. It ran and fed filament okay so I proceeded to do some more test prints. The prints were the same.</span><a style="color: #333333; outline: none !important;" title="" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160805222314/http://fabribles.com/images/originalphotos/307/9/0b51e72e024730e6d9b74b8b.jpg" rel="lightbox[gallery]"><img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; vertical-align: middle; border: 0px; max-height: 800px;" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160805222314im_/http://fabribles.com/images/originalphotos/307/9/0b51e72e024730e6d9b74b8b.jpg" alt="" width="600" /> </a><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Last night I noticed that the temperature did not appear to be accurate. I measured the hot end with my laser thermometer and it gave a wildly different result to what was being displayed on the readout. It was far too hot. The thermistor in the J-Type hotend is a 100k type but as there are several different types of 100k thermistor I wondered if I might have got the settings wrong. Reading up on RepRap and the Repetier software it is possible to create your own thermistor tables based on some simply readings.</span></p>
<p><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Using the following spreadsheet - </span><a class="bbcode_url" style="color: #333333; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; outline: none !important;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160805222314/http://www.reprap.org/wiki/File:MeasuringThermistorBeta-ThermistorBeta.ods" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">www.reprap.org/wiki/File:MeasuringThermi...a-ThermistorBeta.ods</a><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> you measure the resistance at two separate temperatures to calculate the Beta values that you can then enter into the Repetier firmware which it will use to create a generic thermistor table.</span><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I took the resistance readings at room temperature (nominally 100000 ohms @ 25 degress) and again at about the operating temperature (I measured 9K7 @ 198 degrees) this gave me a calculated Beta value of 2457. I entered this into the Repetier firmware and uploaded it.</span><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I then set the printer on pre-heat and compared the temperature readout with the measured temperature from my temperature gun. The result was much better but not perfect. I then noted that the Rumba board has an onboard pullup resistor so I adjusted the settings to include the onboard 4K7 resistor and tried again. Better but still way off.</span><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">What I noted watching the temperature was that the onboard temperature readout rose until it got to about 8 or 90 degress but then slowed whilst the actual temperature kept rising. Eventually the onboard temperature appeared to level out at 180 degrees (the preset setting for PLA) which it appeared to maintain with no issues excpet that the actual measured temperature was somewhere nearer to 290 degrees.</span><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I tried various configurations but was unable to get the thermistor to accurately control the hot end. In the end I decided to hook up the spare hot end that I have to try that instead.</span><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Initially I reverted to the baseline settings for a 100k thermistor figuring that I could monitor that temperature with the laser thermometer and kill the power should it get too high. I chose the PLA pre-heat settings and watched the temperature rise. The temperature readout on the printer was about 10 degrees off of the measured temperature but it seemed to be fine. Looks like there was a duff thermistor in the old hot end.</span><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I set up the same test that I had previously been having issues with and watched as it printed out with no issues.</span><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">From what I can see the thermistor was faulty allowing the hot end to get too hot. This had the effect of overheating the PLA which caused the initial layers to print very poorly. Once the hot PLA from the hot end chamber was consumed and PLA was flowing through the hot end the print stabilised a bit. With the thermistor working correctly and the hot end at the correct temperature the print was much better.</span><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I managed to print the test print with no dramas and also printed a 25mm cube. There is still a bit of tweaking to do but the printer is finally working. Now that it prints I can concentrate on improving the quality which should hopefully just be a matter of tweaking</span></p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">WAF withstanding I went out and purchased a new hot glue gun. It was only $10 from our local $2 store (go figure). You should be able to pick one up from any cheap-as-chips type of variety store. The ones you find in craft shops may be a bit more expensive, but then I assume that they are probably better quality than the $10 ones too.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">When I got home I could not resist taking the gun apart (don't try this at home kids). My initial plan was to see if I could change the 'nozzle' to something a little smaller so that I could use a single filament but what I found with this particular gun was that the entire 'hot end' was one solid cast part. Interestingly the glue gun is very similar in operation to a standard 3D printer hot end except that the heating element is 240volts.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">As it looked like it was not going to be possible to <em style="box-sizing: border-box;">easily</em> modify the gun to accept a single filament I decided to move on to plan B.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Plan B involved making a large filament. I considered printing some 'filament sticks' on the 3D printer - basically a glue stick made from filament but then decided to simply get a whole bunch of filament strands and bunch them together instead. I opted to use PLA for my testing as it melts at a lower temperature then ABS.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I fed the 'filament stick' into the hot glue gun and waited for it to heat up. Once up to temperature I noted that the trigger mechanism was not really working with the filament  bunched up as I had it. It would of course be possible to print out a more suitable design but for the purposes of my test I decided that I would simply push the filament through by hand.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Whilst the filament is not as easy to push through as the glue sticks, it does work surprisingly well. So well in fact that I was even able to be a little creative...</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I'm obviously not going to win any prizes for my artistic ability but the proof that it worked was reward enough. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">With the glue gun unmodified the resulting extrusion is quite large in diameter however i found that this is a perfect size for 'gluing' separate parts together, making repairs to prints or otherwise just creating large blobs of molten plastic. I think that it would also be very good for repairing broken plastic items, especially if made from the same material. Whilst I did not try ABS I'm pretty confident that with the end of the nozzle at 120 degrees it will also melt with no issues.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">A further refinement would be to fit a smaller nozzle to the glue gun to make a smaller extrusion. With a little adaptation it might even be possible to use a standard hot end nozzle.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Of course the glue gun is not as easy to handle as the 3doodler, especially with the trigger not functioning so to overcome this issue I designed some filament sticks with grooves around them to engage in the trigger mechanism. This works really well and make the 'filament gun' much easier to handle.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">If you want to print some filament sticks out yourself you can download them from the Physibles section - HERE</p>

The complete rod weighs in at 7 grams including a 3mm nut and bolt at each end. What I had figured out was that by using this setup and crimping the ends as outlined in my earlier post you could get rid of the backlash springs (about 2 grams per axis) . Also as the rod connectors we not used in this design there was an additional saving there (4 grams per axis). I figured out that the additional weight of the larger rods was a non-issue when considering the weight that had been removed by the design change.</span><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Anyhow, back to the stepper motors....</span><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">So to calculate the torque requirements for the motors you can use the following formula (vertical linear motion). It is a simple formula based on the weight being suspended from a pulley attached to the motor - exactly the same as the 3DR.

	  <p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">If you create your own 3D models for 3D printing you might have wondered which of the current free mainstream 3D modellers gives the best results. To find out we decided to do some benchmarking by testing the current offerings from Google, Autodesk and FreeCAD.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I've been an avid Sketchup user since it's initial free release by Google in 2006. I've used it to design many real-life projects and also had great success using it as a tool to illustrate design concepts to clients. Using Sketchup to design parts for 3D printing seemed like a natural transition, especially with the STL import / export plugin allowing me to be able to create files that I could directly import into my slicing program. The STL plugin really empowered me to create things for my printer that otherwise I might not have been able to. Without it I might have just had to make do with downloading things from Thingiverse.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">One thing I noticed with the things I printed from Sketchup was that many of the curved faces had signs of faceting. Evidence that my curves were in fact made of many straight lines was readily apparent in some models. This led me to thinking about why this was happening. I decided that I needed to do some investigation</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Phil, a friend of mine, who I also run this site with is a mechanical engineer who just so happens to maintain a copy of Inventor for his work. We decided that what was needed was to compare a model created by Inventor against the same model created in Sketchup. After a bit of discussion we decided that we would use the letter 'G' from the Times New Roman truetype font as both programs could easily utilize this to create a 3D letter to print and it was full of curves of varying size and so would be a good test. The Google / G connection was purely unitentional.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Not surprisingly, what we ended up with was a nice smooth letter 'G' from the inventor model and a faceted 'G' from Sketchup. Happy that the faceting was not related to the printer or our slicing software the next step was to find an alternative free modeller and test it using our newly created 'G-Test'.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">FreeCAD</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I've actually had FreeCAD installed on my machine for some time but apart from a cursory look never got into it. Faced with the challenge of the G-Test I decided that it was time to get to grips with it.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Freecad is not the easiest program to use. Whilst it appears to be feature packed and seems to be very capable I had a lot of trouble getting my head around creating even basic models without resorting to online help. Being a software engineer and writing a lot of GUIs I can usually find my way around most programs with no issue but Free cad was an unusual exception to this rule. I think that most of this simply stemmed from the fact that there were too many different operating modes and toolsets. The ironic thing is that this is probably a feature to make the software easier to use.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Usability issues aside, possibly the worst thing that I found with Freecad was that it simply kept crashing. it took me ages to perform a simple change to my model as every time that I tried it crashed. This did not give a very pleasant user experience at all.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">The other issue that I found with Freecad was that I could not figure out how to insert true type fonts into the model. This meant that our awesomely devised G-test had to be replaced with something that would work on all 3D CAD packages. In the end we decided that a simple hemispherical shape 50mm in diameter would be a good enough test of both the rendering and STL output capabilities. Incidentally it was trying to chop a sphere in half to create the 50mm test model that caused Freecad to bomb out.</p>

Here's the resultant STL loaded up into Replicator-G</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; vertical-align: middle; border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="b2ap3_thumbnail_Screen-Shot-2013-09-13-at-9.59.27-PM.png" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160804183836im_/http://fabribles.com/../../../../images/blog_images/308/b2ap3_thumbnail_Screen-Shot-2013-09-13-at-9.59.27-PM.png" alt="b2ap3_thumbnail_Screen-Shot-2013-09-13-at-9.59.27-PM.png" /></p>

This was visible in both the rendering in the program and also in Replicator-G. The print itself also showed signs of this.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Having changed the G-Test to use a 50mm hemisphere I had to reprint my test model. Whilst all of the other programs tested here include spheres as a basic shape Sketchup does not. this means that you have to create one using the 'follow' command. This is not something that is easily figured out so a quick tutorial might be of assistance if like me you could not quite get the follow command to work correctly.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">One great thing about Sketchup is that it's pretty simple to use and very robust.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Here's my 50mm hemisphere in Sketchup</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">No frills, and a bit artificial looking but a hemisphere none the less. So far there is not really much to tell.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Exporting the model to an STL file requires a plugin. This plugin can be downloaded from the sketchup extensions warehouse website. Originally written by third party contributors it is now supported by Sketchup themselves.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Here's where things start to get interesting. Here is the STL model loaded into Replicator-G</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; vertical-align: middle; border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="b2ap3_thumbnail_Screen-Shot-2013-09-13-at-8.55.18-PM.png" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160804183836im_/http://fabribles.com/../../../../images/blog_images/308/b2ap3_thumbnail_Screen-Shot-2013-09-13-at-8.55.18-PM.png" alt="b2ap3_thumbnail_Screen-Shot-2013-09-13-at-8.55.18-PM.png" /></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">You can instantly see the faceting on the object. In fact with the hemisphere it is a lot more pronounced than with the letter that I had printed earlier. It probably of no surprise that the print ended up looking like this...</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; vertical-align: middle; border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="b2ap3_thumbnail_IMG_8537.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160804183836im_/http://fabribles.com/../../../../images/blog_images/308/b2ap3_thumbnail_IMG_8537.jpg" alt="b2ap3_thumbnail_IMG_8537.jpg" /></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">123D Design</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">As if by some kind of freaky coincidence at about the same time that I decided to look for other 3D modellers I become aware of a new suite of programs by Autodesk. Autodesk is the the same company that is responsible for both AutoCAD and Inventor. Amongst the offerings is a program called 123D Design which has a version for both desktop computers and the iPad. Obviously this was quickly downloaded and installed</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">The interface to 123D Design is very slick and feels a lot smoother to use than Sketchup. There are many features and styling queues that are obviously inspired by Inventor which is a very good thing. Using 123D Design is fairly straightforward if you are already used to using something like Sketchup so it did not take me too long to figure out how the create a basic model. The 'Primitives' menu is a nice feature - this allows you to insert common geometric shapes such as cubes and cylinders which makes it much faster to create things. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; vertical-align: middle; border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="b2ap3_thumbnail_Screen-Shot-2013-09-13-at-8.33.22-PM.png" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160804183836im_/http://fabribles.com/../../../../images/blog_images/308/b2ap3_thumbnail_Screen-Shot-2013-09-13-at-8.33.22-PM.png" alt="b2ap3_thumbnail_Screen-Shot-2013-09-13-at-8.33.22-PM.png" /></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">123D Design also comes with some commands that you will not find in Sketchup - namely sweep, revolve and loft. Whilst similar results can be obtained with the 'follow' command in Sketchup the inclusion of these commands is a real game changer for anyone looking for a free 3D modeller as they open up a lot more possibilities.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">STL export is a native feature of 123D Design but as with the Sketchup version there are no options to change the default conversion parameters. The lack of parameters for STL export is soon forgotten when you see the results</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; vertical-align: middle; border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="b2ap3_thumbnail_Screen-Shot-2013-09-13-at-11.06.03-PM.png" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160804183836im_/http://fabribles.com/../../../../images/blog_images/308/b2ap3_thumbnail_Screen-Shot-2013-09-13-at-11.06.03-PM.png" alt="b2ap3_thumbnail_Screen-Shot-2013-09-13-at-11.06.03-PM.png" /></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">The resultant model is clearly the smoothest of the three models created. This is easily visible when viewing the STL file in Replicator-G. The printed part is also the same, much smoother and noticeably less surface undulations than the Freecad part.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; vertical-align: middle; border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="b2ap3_thumbnail_IMG_8539.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160804183836im_/http://fabribles.com/../../../../images/blog_images/308/b2ap3_thumbnail_IMG_8539.jpg" alt="b2ap3_thumbnail_IMG_8539.jpg" /></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Here's a side by side shot of all three next to each other. Left to right we have Sketchup, Freecad and finally 123D Design.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; vertical-align: middle; border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="b2ap3_thumbnail_IMG_8533.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160804183836im_/http://fabribles.com/../../../../images/blog_images/308/b2ap3_thumbnail_IMG_8533.jpg" alt="b2ap3_thumbnail_IMG_8533.jpg" /></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Clearly there is a massive difference with the the Autodesk product, but what about comparing it with the professional packages?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">To give our results some kind of  grounding I asked Phil to create a 50mm sphere in Inventor. I also asked Phil to export it using the default STL settings as unlike the programs we have been testing it is possible to tweak the resolution of the STL output file.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Here's the 50mm sphere in Inventor. It's easy to see the similarities with 123D Design</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">And here's the resultant STL file in Replicator-G. Again very similar in quality to the 123D Design file</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; vertical-align: middle; border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="b2ap3_thumbnail_Screen-Shot-2013-09-20-at-1.26.15-PM.png" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160804183836im_/http://fabribles.com/../../../../images/blog_images/308/b2ap3_thumbnail_Screen-Shot-2013-09-20-at-1.26.15-PM.png" alt="b2ap3_thumbnail_Screen-Shot-2013-09-20-at-1.26.15-PM.png" /></p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">The printed part is almost indistinguishable from the 123D design part. It's only really on closer scrutiny that you can discern any difference.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; vertical-align: middle; border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="b2ap3_thumbnail_IMG_8664.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160804183836im_/http://fabribles.com/../../../../images/blog_images/308/b2ap3_thumbnail_IMG_8664.jpg" alt="b2ap3_thumbnail_IMG_8664.jpg" /></p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Here's all of the parts side by side for a comparison. Left to right the parts are: Sketchup, Freecad, 123D Design and Inventor. Looking at the results is easy to know what program I will be using from now on.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; vertical-align: middle; border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="b2ap3_thumbnail_IMG_8662.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160804183836im_/http://fabribles.com/../../../../images/blog_images/308/b2ap3_thumbnail_IMG_8662.jpg" alt="b2ap3_thumbnail_IMG_8662.jpg" /></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Autodesk have clearly entered into the 3D printing arena with a bang. Whilst the 123D Design program may look like a toy, and bundling it up with the other apps in the 123D suite does nothing to help dissuade you of this, it is actually a fully fledged 3D design app. You can easily use it to create anything you want to print and whats more the output quality is right up there with it's bigger brother.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I mentioned earlier that 123D Design is actually part of a suit of programs. This suite also includes apps to create monsters, turn 2D images into 3D models and even a really cool app called 123D Catch. This is a mobile / tablet / online app that allows you to use your normal camera to take multiple images of a subject that are then magically turned into 3D models that you can download and print on your 3D printer.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Whats more is that all of these apps are available on multiple platforms and devices and are all joined together by on online premium cloud service that allows you to share models between your devices and friends. It's obvious that Autodesk are playing hardball in the 3D printing stakes and it would not surprise me if they came out on top. Inventor is the defacto standard for 3D modelling and it stands to reason that they have both the funding and knowledge to make a serious play in the emergent 3D printing field.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Conclusions</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Sketchup might be the easiest to get to grips with but 123D Design is really not that much harder to use. I would definitely recommending putting the extra effort into learning 123D Design, especially if you actually plan to print any of your models. The 123D Design iPad app is also a consideration for those who might want to design on-the-go. The iPad app is almost identical to the desktop version except that it does not appear to allow you to enter dimensional data for your models.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">With competition like 123D Design,  Freecad is simply not worth the bother. It's complex, buggy and to be fair is probably aimed at power users and larger multi-component designs. I would say that it has more in common with inventor than Sketchup. The STL quality is good, and if you are already familiar with Freecad there is no reason not to use it ,but the learning curve for new users and the ease of use that the competition has simply rules it out.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />123D Design gets the two thumbs up from me.</p>

Its hidden drives and concealed workings make for a much more visually appealing printer. It's something that I would be happy to have sit on my desk at home, although I think I might not choose the harlequin color scheme that RichRap has </span><img class="bbcode_smiley" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; vertical-align: middle; border: 0px; max-height: 800px; color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" title=":lol:" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20161008193744im_/http://fabribles.com/media/kunena/emoticons/grin.png" alt=":lol:" width="19" height="19" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> .</span><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I also like the fact that the printer is designed to be easily expandable in size by simply adding some spacers to the existing base and top parts, the design is really ingenious and well thought out</span><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><br style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" /><span style="color: #777777; font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">My plan is to order the electronic parts that I need to build the printer and whilst I am waiting for these to arrive print out the 3D printed parts that I need.

I will likely make these from non 3D-printed parts - Threaded plastic or aluminum tube seems like a better solution.

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;" />Inspired by the <a style="color: #5990de; outline: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; background: transparent;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160804003358/http://blog.reprap.org/2013/02/vapor-treating-abs-rp-parts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attempts of others</a>, and wanting to achieve a better finish for some parts that we are looking to produce for sale, we decided to put together a vapor bath. Before we got stuck in we watched a few YouTube videos and read a few blogs and decided to come up with a shortlist of considerations that we could use to drive our design. Here's what we came up with.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" /><br style="box-sizing: border-box;" /><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Temperature requirements</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; padding-left: 30px;">Acetone boils at about 56 degrees so a relatively low heat source is required. Acetone will not actually ignite until it gets to <span style="box-sizing: border-box; white-space: nowrap;">465 °C so we decided that there was little danger of it combusting with any heat that we were planning to throw at it.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;" /></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Size</strong></p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Heat source</strong></p>

Either would need a controller and power supply unit of some sort.</p>

We had some nice perforated aluminum laying around in the workshop so figured that we would make up a platten to place the parts on.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Cooling condensor</strong></p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Enclosure &amp; lid</strong></p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Condensation on platen affecting base of part</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; padding-left: 30px;">From the videos that we had watched there seemed to be a lot of acetone condensation on the platter which the part sat in causing the base of the part to partially melt. We decided that aluminum would be a good material due to it's high heat transference properties, which would mean that the acetone should not condense on it. Plus we figured that the perforated aluminum that we had found would allow good heat / vapor circulation</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;">Time needed to process part</strong></p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Armed with our list of considerations we were pretty confident that we could come up with something that would work. To get a little further inspiration we decided to do a bit more research and stumbled across <a style="color: #5990de; outline: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; background: transparent;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160804003358/http://solidoodletips.wordpress.com/2012/10/24/diy-smoothing-station/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solidoodletips blog</a> where he constructed something very akin to the trichloroethane parts washer that we had been pondering over. One feature that we liked very much was that the part was placed much lower than the acetone level improving the vapor distribution. Other videos that we had watched seemed to have an issue getting the vapor to rise high enough to cover the whole part and so this seemed to make a lot of sense.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">We also found <a style="color: #5990de; outline: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; background: transparent;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160804003358/http://thegreatfredini.com/2013/04/20/3d-printing-tip-of-the-week-cheap-acetone-vapor-part-finisher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Great Fredini's blog post</a> about using cooking steamers. This actually seemed like a much better idea than ours. Using a cooking steamer there would be no waiting for a heat bed to be delivered, no wiring up of controllers or PSUs, plus we knew that we could get a steamer dirt cheap from our local Kmart - much cheaper than the sum of the parts that we were planning to use. So deciding to compromise - off to Kmart we went.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Unfortunately the steamers that Kmart stocked had plastic baskets for the food which looked like they would melt with the acetone. They did have a deep fat fryer that looked like it might do that job but we were worried about the temperature of the heating element being too hot. In the end we settled on a slow cooker and found a suitable pan to fit inside it planning to improvise on the idea of placing the part lower than the acetone level.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Here's what we ended up with. We also bought a digital BBQ thermometer to help keep an eye on the temps.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I bent up a platten from the perforated aluminum and made some handles from some fencing wire so that we could easily lift the platten into and out of the pan. The bent sides act as feet allowing the part to sit above the acetone level.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Next up was to assemble everything and fill the slow cooker up with acetone and then set the pan into it. Obviously the pan floats so the pan needed a way of being held into position, unfortunately there was nothing around to make a suitable hold down from so i decided to forgo this and use the acetone directly inside of the slow cooker instead. I will take a look at making a suitable clamp at a later date.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Putting everything together I ended up removing the handle from the lid so that the temperature probe could be positioned through the hole, this was so that the lid could be sealed properly. I figured that the slow cooker needs the lid to seal so that it can retain the vapors within the pot and not simply boil dry, this seemed like the best solution.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">The acetone was added and the cooker set to high. A part was also added to test. It took approximately 30 minutes for the acetone to heat up to the point where it was condensing on the underside of the lid.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Here you can see the acetone condensing on the lid, the temperature is measured at 54.3 degrees Celsius which probably means that the actual temperature of the acetone is a little higher (probably about it's 56/57 degree boiling point).  As the vapor was generated you could see the base of the part start to get wet, this wetness rose up the side of the part until the part was completely damp. Cool. Things look like they are working!</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Expecting that the smoothing process would take approximately an hour or so I set my watch to keep a check on the time. What I found was that after a further 30 minutes the temperature inside the pot had kept on rising, in fact it rose right up to nearly 80 degrees and most of the acetone simply boiled away. Adding some more acetone I also opted to add another part at the same time as I wanted to check the difference in processing time between adding a part at the start of the heating process, and adding a part to the already heated pot.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">One thing that I noticed was that as I lowered the parts into the pot, the new part pretty much instantly ended up in the same condition that the previous part had taken an hour to get to, it basically instantly glossed over. There was no discernible difference between the two. Turning the pot down to it's low setting I left both parts in for a further hour before the acetone again mostly boiled away. I then decided to take the parts out and inspect them.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">When I removed the parts I noticed that there had been no real further smoothing of the surface but there had been quite a bit of bubbling on the second part. This part had actually been sanded a little prior to being added and so had a slightly different surface finish so this could have been a contributing factor. However, considering that the first part had been in the vapor bath for two hours the finish was merely glossy and not really as smoothed as I would have expected. The base of both parts were also starting to melt and become fused with the perforations in the base. Clearly things were not working out as expected.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"><img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; vertical-align: middle; border: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="b2ap3_thumbnail_IMG_8602.jpg" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160804003358im_/http://fabribles.com/../../../../images/blog_images/308/Acetone%20Bath/b2ap3_thumbnail_IMG_8602.jpg" alt="b2ap3_thumbnail_IMG_8602.jpg" /> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Not perturbed I had a bit of a rethink. The base was possibly getting too hot, as was the acetone. To counteract this I decided to fill the slow cooker with hot water and then place the second pot inside. The parts were then placed inside of the second pot. Pretty much like you would if you were melting wax or chocolate.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">This new configuration had the effect of both lowering the temperature and stabilizing the acetone evaporation. The temperature of the water stayed pretty steady at about 55 degrees - perfect simmering temperature for the acetone.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Inspired by what I had witnessed when adding the second part I decided to do a bit of an experiment and only add the parts in for a short while. What I did was to add the part and then place the lid on the pan, I then waited for the acetone to start condensing on the underside of the lid (good job we bought a pan and a cooker with a glass lid) before removing the parts after a further minute or so. I then let the parts dry a little before repeating the process.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I found that this gives a much better result. Not only is it quicker, but the effect is much more controlled. Using this method I was even able to smooth out the bubbles that had appeared in one of the parts.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Here you can see the reflection of the perforated mesh in one of the parts. The striations left by the printing process have been completely removed. Whilst this looks pretty good other portions of the part still had imperfections but this is most likely due to the initial quality of the parts I used for the test.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Overall we deemed the test a success. We successfully managed to smooth some ABS parts out with a home made acetone vapor chamber. Sure we concede that the results were not perfect, and there is definitely room for improvement but the basic goal was achieved.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">The end method ended up a fair bit different from the originally planned process, but as with all things like this, some experimentation is needed before you find what works. We figure that our results differed a little from our original plan due to our use of a slow cooker instead of a steamer. We did consider using a hot plate or electric fry pan but were a little worried about the heat. This is probably a good thing as all that really seems to happen at higher temperatures is that the acetone boils away and evaporates quicker.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">From what I have seen with our experiment the same result could probably be easily achieved using a large cooking pot with a glass lid and a suitable bowl placed inside. Simply pour some hot water from an electric kettle in the cooking pot, and then place the bowl of acetone in the water. Then suspend your prints over the acetone using a suitable platten and put the lid on the pot. I'm pretty sure that you will get a result with this although without a heat source you may need to replenish the hot water once it cools.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Next steps are to repeat the test with some decent parts on a solid platten. The perforations in the platten allowed the part to sink a little which basically ruined the base of the part. At least with a solid base the part would remain flat and hopefully useable. Aluminum definitely seems to be the go as there was no condensation on it at all so I need to go raid my scrap pile and see if I can find a suitable piece to make a new platten out of.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Phil is drafting up the final parts and so our next test will be to smooth the actual finished parts.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 9px; box-sizing: border-box; color: #777777; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Will keep you posted of the progress</p>

	  <p>If you are familiar with&nbsp;<a href="http://stackideas.com/" target="_blank">Stack Ideas</a>&nbsp;products, such as the blogging component that you are reading from right now EasyBlog, you might have noticed that on&nbsp;their&nbsp;site they have been promoting a soon to be released social&nbsp;networking&nbsp;component called&nbsp;<a href="http://stackideas.com/easysocial/" target="_blank">EasySocial</a>.&nbsp;I first noticed this a few weeks back and I must admit I got a bit excited.&nbsp;Not one to usually get emotional over such things, the idea of a social networking component written by the excellent Stack Ideas team definitely has appeal.</p>
<p>I have a love / hate relationship with most extension vendors and products but my experience with Stack Ideas has been great, the support is excellent, the products are intuitive and of the best quality, and what's more they just work. No fuss, no hacking, no convoluted setup, they work with the minimum of fuss and continue to do so.&nbsp;So when I received an email that there would be a webcast on the upcoming EasySocial, I signed up right away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watching the webcast last night I was blown away by the quality of component. There has been a years worth of development so far and there are still features that are being held back for the next release (Boonex please take note). The component includes many ideas and suggestions from the Stack Ideas user base and whilst it was said that the component was not&nbsp;designed&nbsp;to specifically compete against JomSocial, it certainly raises the bar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In many respects it is similar in functionality to JomSocial, it follows the standard format for social networking components - that of a facebookesque type of site with an activity wall, profile pages, messaging capabilities, etc. Where it differs is how these components have been executed, it's the fine details that really set it apart. There is a liberal use of AJAX for all functions resulting in what appears to be a very nice user experience, the interface also appears to be very intuitive, although this is&nbsp;obviously&nbsp;hard to really get a feel for from just watching on a webcast.</p>
<p>The setup for registration and the integration of all of the Stack Ideas components within the EasySocial framework has been well thought out. The registration and integration of third party components has also been well considered with API functions to allow developers to directly include fields for&nbsp;their&nbsp;components within the registration form. This in itself is a major breakthrough and is one thing that is usually a massive pain to execute when building a site.</p>
<p>My contribution to the evening was quizzing Stack Ideas about JomSocial migration, there is a migration function included, which also migrates the activity stream but currently does not include groups or events. This is simply because groups and events are not currently in the product. Groups and events are due to be release with the next release at which point they will no doubt be included within the migrator.&nbsp;Interestingly groups are being referred to as 'pages' which seems to me that StackIdeas are taking&nbsp;their&nbsp;queues&nbsp;from Facebook more than JomSocial, this is also echoed by the integration of opengraph tags.</p>
<p>Overall I was very impressed with EasySocial and cannot wait to get my hands on a copy. Release is not currently set but is pencilled to be within the next week or two. Pricing was also discussed but no commitment was made. With the exclusion of the groups and events components I would not be ready to roll this out for all of my sites but would definitely be happy to give it a go on those sites that that do not use this functionality. Looks like JomSocial need to up&nbsp;their&nbsp;game.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2013/08/16/jomsocial-css-maxification-less-is-actually-more.html">JomSocial CSS Maxification - less is actually more</a></h2>
	  <p>Just been putting a site together on the new JomSocial version 3. One of the first things I always do (as you should) is create a new template - a clone of the original one. This way I can hack away at creating the site and develop the template as I go along without changing the default.</p>
<p>Changing the style of elements by CSS is a pretty normal act and one that I prefer to do with the original CSS and not by overrides as is always suggested by vendors. Normally I use Coda to de-minify any minified CSS and then re-minify it once I have finished. For some reason I was hitting a few issues when de-minifying the standard templates style.css file, it seemed to be replacing any reference to images with an ASCII reference instead of the path and filename data. Guessing that this must be due to the method used to compress the file (something other than the normal whitespace stripper) I went on a hunt to find out what was up with the new CSS file format.</p>
<p>Not finding too much I stumbled across T<a href="http://www.jomsocial.com/forum/technical-issues/7485-solved-why-are-there-no-line-breaks-in-my-jomsocial-css-files/reply" target="_blank">his Post </a>which simply suggests that the CSS files should not be modified but does not say how they were compressed and how to de-minify them. It does however give a clue - 'use less compiler'.</p>
<p>So I goggled 'useless compiler' and came across the <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">http://lesscss.org/</a> website. I say 'useless' with my tongue in my cheek, for on the first page there is a bit of a breakdown showing some examples, one is the use of variables.</p>
<pre class="brush:css">  // LESS

@color: #4D926F;

#header {
  color: @color;
}
h2 {
  color: @color;
}
</pre>
<p>I was very (very) amused at this. They are seriously suggesting using more characters as a way of saving space. Phah. The devil is in the details and this kind of thing gets on my nerves. Of course there are better examples, like urls for instance, which is exactly the reason for my images not showing up properly. Well at least I can now do a search-and-destroy on the offending items and get a real CSS file back into play.</p>
<p>The whole issue made me think of my arch nemesis the Dolphin CMS where every single module uses template overrides. I spent quite a time trying to convince Boonex that using template overrides massively increased page load times, and using 50 of them was what was slowing their page load times down but no one would listen.</p>
<p>So it got me to thinking, and this got me to testing.</p>
<p>I decided to do some benchmarking using the page I was developing. I decided to record the average load time for the CSS file.</p>
<p>First off - The minified file. This returned an average load time of 1.18ms</p>
<p>Next up the de-minified file. This returned an average load time of 1.19ms.</p>
<p>Clearly there is a saving, which is what we would expect, but not as much as you would think there would be, there really isn't that much in it.</p>
<p>So, what about the additional file used by the inheritance method prescribed above? and the increase in page load times that I always preach is the result? First off a little background behind my reasoning: Having written and implemented many serial communications protocols in the past I learned first hand that the file open and file close actions along with the associated handshaking and checksums usually result in more of a resource drag than the actual file transmission itself. This was especially true of small text transmissions; which is pretty much what a CSS file is. It is also the reason for connection persistence. The result was that the connection and disconnection take more time than the file transfer itself. Applying the same logic and by the same reasoning I always considered that CSS inheritance was a resource hog.</p>
<p>So what about those load times I hear you say?. Well here you go...</p>
<p>The recommended template override file takes an amazing average load time of 1.14ms and this is an EMPTY file except for the required @import statement. So now we have to ADD this to the load time for the original minified file as this still gets loaded, what we end up with is actually 2.32ms - nearly DOUBLE the load time of an un-minified style.css file. WOW!</p>
<p>Given that there is really no noticeable difference between the minified and non-minified load times is there really any benefit to minifying the file? especially when it is recommended to leave the original file alone and use inheritance instead.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that the style.css file I used is particularly large for a CSS file as it weighs in at a hefty 362KB. The other file was a mere 87 bytes in size but they both had practically the same load time. Ironically I actually did a series of tests and on occasion the deminified file would sometimes load faster but on average I obtained the figures above.</p>
<p>Minification is certainly a time saver, and along with other compression and caching methods will help to bring page load times down, but using a cryptic minification method like JomSocial are is really unnecessary, it simply makes it hard to work with the files. I also dislike the suggestion that users use file inheritance to override template parameters as this is practically doubling the required resources needed to process the stylesheets if not more once you consider that the DOM parser has to process some style elements twice.</p>
<p>My 02c - I think that JomSocial should just supply the uncompressed CSS files and ignore the 0.05ms penalty from the 5 or so files used in the template, I also think that they should stop recommending inheritance as a method of overriding the templates because of the additional delays it introduces. The way I see things is that they are causing a massive headache for most of their end users by changing their templating structure to something that is hard to read, hard to de-minify and generally obstructive to the whole smooth user experience. I'm sure their users will thank them for it. Hopefully the irony of increased page load times and un-usability being the result of trying to make page load times faster is not lost on JomSocial, but given my <a href="blog/entry/general/jomsocial-group-discussion-exploit">recent experience</a> with them things seem to have changed over in the Azrul offices and it does not appear to be for the better.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2013/08/08/you-cannot-access-the-private-section-of-this-site.html">You cannot access the private section of this site.</a></h2>
	  <p>This was the error I was recently faced with when I re-enabled user registrations here on the DeeEmm site.</p>
<p>You may recall from my last blog post&nbsp;<a href="entry/general/virtuemart-revisited">Virtuemart Revisited</a>&nbsp;that I have recently re-installed Virtuemart so that I can sell some extensions via a store front right here on the site.&nbsp;As part of my testing I run through the usual user experience to check that things work as they should and found that after registering a user, confirming the account and then being enabled by an administrator the 'You cannot access the private section of this site.' message was displayed and the new user could not log in.<a class="PostHeader" href="http://tips.paddyonline.net/other-generic/various-tips-tricks/other-generic/joomla-error-you-cannot-access-the-private-section-of-this-site" style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1em; text-decoration: underline; text-align: left; color: #1e6c7b; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br /></a></p>
<p>Hmmnnn, not good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I&nbsp;check&nbsp;the ACL to ensure that the 'registered' user level has login access to the site. All good there so that isn't the issue. I then turn to Google to see what that turns up and find that most of the solutions given&nbsp;relate&nbsp;to the ACL permissions.</p>
<p>Hmmnnn, so what next?</p>
<p>A bit more digging and I find that this was a common error when migrating from 1.5, which is exactly what I had done, albeit at some point in the distant past. Obviously this had never been raised as an issue as I did not have user registrations enabled but now that I needed to reenable them it was time to fix the problem.</p>
<p>The cause of the issue is somewhat odd and is related to the #__assets table. The assets table stores the relational data that is used to determine the parent &gt; child relationships of all site content. Normally the top level entry is the 'Root Asset' with a parent_id of 0 along side the top level categories which may also have a parent_id of 0. The issue arises if there are any articles that have a parent_id of 0, for some reason this messes with the permissions engine and will not allow normal users to log in.</p>
<p>It's pretty easy to check by either browsing to the #__assets table in phpMyAdmin and filtering the results on the parent_id field or by simply running the following SQL Query.&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="brush:sql">SELECT * FROM `#__assets` WHERE `parent_id` = 0
</pre>
<p>The fix is equally as simple, or at least it can be if you want to assign all the stray articles to a single category. Simply run the following SQL Query and replace the parent_id value with the id corresponding to the category you want to assign the rogue articles to</p>
<pre class="brush:sql">UPDATE `#__assets` SET `parent_id` = 1 WHERE `parent_id`= 0 AND NOT `id` = 1
</pre>
<p style="text-align: left;">This will update all records except the very first record which should be the&nbsp;aforementioned&nbsp;'Root Asset'</p>
<p>You can&nbsp;verify&nbsp;that the Root Asset still has correct parent_id by running the following SQL Query&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="brush:sql">SELECT * FROM `#__assets` WHERE `id` = 0 OR `parent_id` = 0
</pre>
<p>This should return just the Root Asset record. If for some&nbsp;reason&nbsp;it does not you can correct this and set parent_id back to 0 with the following SQL Query</p>
<div>
<div id="highlighter_270126">
<pre class="brush:sql">UPDATE `#__assets` SET `parent_id` = 0 WHERE `title = "Root Asset"
</pre>
<p>I opted to manually trawl through my records and assign each item to the correct category but I only did this as I have a variety of articles in a variety of categories and only about a dozen or so entries that needed fixing. The end result was that a plethora of articles that had been MIA for some time suddenly appeared back in the tutorials section. The mismatched parent_id value was actually preventing the articles from showing.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>It was quite worrying to think that this issue had actually been present for quite some time and due to the user registrations being disabled had never been discovered. It always goes to show that there is no substitute for a team of testers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2013/08/07/virtuemart-revisited.html">Virtuemart Revisited</a></h2>
	  <p>Over time I have gone through various stages of selling mods and extensions and somehow every time have ended up vowing never to do it again. I think in&nbsp;retrospect&nbsp;this has mostly this has been due to the piracy that seems to go hand in hand with the web extension community and the frustration that you get when you get your hard work ripped off by some snotty little script kiddy. In every case, the mods and extensions that I have written have ended up being released open source and for free. In fact these same mods and extensions are still available on the <a href="downloads">downloads</a> page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see by the date on most of those items, it has been a few years since I have actively developed stuff for a wider audience. Most of the stuff I wrote was for the Boonex Dolphin platform, and whilst I ended up moving away from Dolphin to Joomla and JomSocial I never bothered to release any of the modifications, plugins and extensions that I had written for my sites on the Joomla / JomSocial platform.</p>
<p>Recently I have been developing some <a href="entry/general/cloning-your-joomla-site">interesting things</a> and have been toying with the idea of&nbsp;releasing&nbsp;them for sale, I also have the Dolphin to JomSocial migrator that I have up until now not made available to the public. So with a renewed interest in once again selling mods and extensions but this time for the Joomla / JomSocial platform I decided to put a recent plugin that I wrote up for sale.</p>
<p><a href="store/jomsocial/jomsocial-auto-group-detail">The plugin</a> is a simple extension for JomSocial that automatically adds new members to a JomSocial group. I wrote this simply because the only available version that I could find to purchase required an expensive 3 month subscription purchase to download. Something as simple as this is not worth the $30 &nbsp;subscription price that was being asked so I decided it would be better/cheaper/easier write my own. Having written it I could also see an opportunity to sell it to others who wanted the plugin but did not want to cough up the subscription for just one extension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Enter Virtuemart</h3>
<p>So with a new extension to sell and a potential market to sell it to all I needed was a vehicle to sell it by. I had originally offered my previous extensions for sale via Virtuemart, so having already once before travelled the road of online store selection I decided to simply cut to the chase and head straight to the Virtuemart site. I must admit I was&nbsp;pleasantly&nbsp;surprised to find that it had been updated and there was a new look website. Whilst I was not too sure about the Windows-8-esque tiled 'surface' layout (regular readers will recall that I'm a bit of a Mac fanboi) it looked a lot more professional and presentable than the previous site which as I recall looked exactly as you would expect an open source project page to look **.&nbsp;So I downloaded Virtuemart and installed it ready to sell my one plugin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing that I found was that there were a lot of un-parsed language strings in the admin panel. Not a good start. I soldiered on and&nbsp;reinstalled&nbsp;and managed to fix that issue. (it was a file permissions issue - easily preventible by ensuring that the packaged files start off with the correct file permissions). Next up I added in the necessary details to set up my shop and add a product. This process was easy enough, the layout is <em>fairly</em> intuitive, although in my opinion it could do with a bit of a rethink as it is very clunky.</p>
<p>I'm not a big fan of accordion menus in administration interfaces, I much prefer to be able to view a menus contents by hovering over it and this simply does not work with accordion menus, but whatever, this is just a personal preference. Same thing with the choice of menus and location of certain menu items, for example the link to return to the top control panel layout is in the bottom menu, go figure. Also the configuration settings are all housed in&nbsp;their&nbsp;own dedicated menu, all except the configuration for the shop which is in a different menu. It seems to me that there is a mixture of menu philosophies in effect - the&nbsp;configuration&nbsp;menu clearly is based on functionality, whereas the shop menu appears to be based on name. This mixture is most definitely NOT intuitive. I would advocate moving the shop configuration item from&nbsp;the&nbsp;shop menu into the configuration menu and renaming it something like 'storefront' but Like I said that's just my take on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Cart Issue</h3>
<p>So with a test product set up, the PayPal payment gateway installed and a menu item added to the site it was time to test. Rather frustratingly I could not add an item to the cart. It would go through the motions but nothing would appear. After a rather frustrating search for a solution in the Virtuemart forums it became apparent that this was a rather common problem. The standard response was that it was a javascript conflict and that this was down to the site owner to fix such issues. Hmmnnn, not really a help. Being a developer, things like this are a big frustration of mine and my immediate thought was that the code was simply not robust enough, it should detect for conflicts BEFORE they occur and then serve a fallback so that functionality does not break.</p>
<p>The actual issue relates to the javascript that is used to generate a lightbox popup once the add item to cart button is pressed. The action fails and the item is not added.&nbsp;Fortunately there was at least an option to manually&nbsp;override&nbsp;this in the backend. I eventually solved the solution by modifying the strapped template to call the jquery library in the header rather then the footer as I did not want to rewrite the 'add to cart' function but it would be better if the devs wrote more robust code.</p>
<p>With this final issue fixed everything was working exactly as it should. The PayPal integration was the simplest I have set up. Having gone through the process of integrating PayPal API calls in other payment gateways I was pleasantly surprised to find that this one only required my paypal account email. I spend a little bit of time scratching my head trying to find out where Virtuemart had hidden the other fields for the PayPal API keys but&nbsp;eventually&nbsp;just opted to make a purchase to try everything out. To my surprise is worked first time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So with everything now working as it should I now needed to upload my first product and set it up for sale. Hmmnnnn, another non-intuitive menu frustration issue. Now where have they hidden this? After trying to figure out where to set up my downloadable product I went back to the forums and searched for some pointers. Well what do you know, another very well reported issue, except that this time it was not actually an issue it was a <em>feature&nbsp;</em> or rather it WAS a feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>No more downloadable products :(</h3>
<p>Somehow in the process of updating Virtuemart from version 1 to version 2 the decision had been made to remove the ability to serve downloadable files. There is a rather verbose discussion on the forums between some irate VM1 users and the devs&nbsp;discussing&nbsp;the reasoning behind this move. The devs standpoint is that it was a little used function and so it was removed. Well at one point in the conversation it is, as elsewhere on the forums they seem to say that they decided to remove it and charge for it to help keep Virtuemart free - after all is is developed by volunteers.</p>
<p>This situation seems all too familiar to me as it seems to echo what goes on over at Boonex where key devs leave out basic functionality so that they can sell&nbsp;their&nbsp;own mods to plug the gaps. The&nbsp;antagonists&nbsp;on the Virtuemart forums point out that they have removed this function to then offer it for sale as a paid extension and that this flies in the face of the open source definition. I somewhat agree with them.</p>
<p>The issue is not necessarily that the downloads extension is commercial, it is that it was a core feature in VM1 that has been removed from a free open source component to be sold for profit. That, as they say just isn't tennis, especially when you consider that they are charging 35 euros for it. There are even&nbsp;rumours&nbsp;that it was still available in beta version of VM2.</p>
<p>The plugin itself is actually rather simple and I'm sure that the devs could have come up with something much better to sell as a cash spinning&nbsp;exercise. It would have been much better to leave the basic download functionality as a core feature and then sell a plugin (or two) to extend it's ability&nbsp;with features such as download limitations or download expirations - features that are often requested.</p>
<p>I think that Virtuemart have alienated quite a few users in this move, especially those VM1 users that used this core feature. Fortunately for me I long ago decided to give all of my VM1 products away for free so I escaped from what must be a frustrating issue for many.</p>
<p>I decided to press ahead with my own&nbsp;endeavour&nbsp;and will use Virtuemarts failings to my advantage&nbsp;by developing a plugin to serve file downloads. What I really want to do is to link Virtuemart sales to the Akeeba Release Rystem (ARS) so that access to releases is only granted when purchased. I will have to figure out a sensible way to&nbsp;achieve&nbsp;this as currently ARS only caters for the Joomla ACL which is role based and not granular.</p>

	  <p>Having moved all of my sites to the Excellent <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=a6a4bd4b10c9" title="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=a6a4bd4b10c9">Digital Ocean</a>&nbsp;hosting I noticed that on some sites the php mail function seemed to be painfully slow and in some cases threw up some error messages telling me that it had failed. Googling didn't turn up too much in the way of solutions, most information seemed to suggest that the sendmail or postfix packages be installed instead.</p>
<p>Whilst sendmail and postfix are both great solutions, I did not really want to install a fully fledged mail server on my box as all email handling for my domains is handled on a separate server. It seemed like too much of a waste of resources so I decided to simply fix the issue with the php mail() function.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After doing a bit of digging I discovered that the issue lay with the hosts file. The host info was incorrect.</p>
<p>Editing the hosts file is pretty easy to do, but first you will need to know what the current hostname is set to. To do this simply type in the following command at the command prompt</p>
<pre>hostname</pre>
<p>This will return the hostname for your server, in my case it was marzipan</p>
<p>Next edit your hosts file. On Ubuntu this is can be found at /etc/hosts. To edit the hosts file invoke your favourite editor, for example</p>
<pre>sudo nano /etc/hosts</pre>
<p>What I found in my hosts file was that the fully qualified local host name was missing. Instead of looking like this</p>
<pre>127.0.0.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; localhost&nbsp;localhost.localdomain marzipan</pre>
<p>It looked like this</p>
<pre>127.0.0.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; localhost marzipan</pre>
<p>I simply edited the file, adding the&nbsp;<em>localhost.localdomain</em>&nbsp;reference and then saved the file. (obviously)</p>
<p>To ensure that the change was picked up I restarted apache, on my server I use the following command</p>
<pre>sudo service apache2 restart</pre>
<p>That's it! My email is now fixed and my websites can happily and easily send email messages without issue. There's no delays and my php code doesn't hang when trying to call the php mail() function. A pretty easy fix for a rather annoying issue.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2013/07/29/cloning-your-joomla-site.html">Cloning your Joomla site</a></h2>
	  <p>A while back I was working on a project that allowed replication of an instance of Joomla. The reason for this was that&nbsp;I have a couple of sites that are set up as SaaS applications. Rather than use the traditional method of selling access to multiple user accounts on a single site I needed to provide complete anonymity between users. The nature of these apps were that all data is private and for me the best way to manage both the&nbsp;segregation&nbsp;and anonymity was to provide completely&nbsp;separate&nbsp;sites for each user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to use a basic site as a template and then replicate it for each user. This meant replicating both the physical files and the database information for each subsequent user.</p>
<p>I had previously used JMS multisites but had found the component to be a bit overly complicated and limiting when used in a commercial capacity as licenses were required for each replication. It also did not do exactly what I required. I did have a look at modifying the code to do what I wanted but in the end my solution was to simply write my own component.</p>
<p>For my setup I required that each instance had it's own subdomain, but that users could log in from the main domain. Each instance was also created from creating a subscription on the main domain.</p>
<p>I settled on only replicating the files and directories that were specifically different for each instance. This meant creating a new&nbsp;configuration&nbsp;file, tmp, cache, log and media folders. Symlinks could be used for the remainder of the information. This also meant that updates could be applied across all sites by updating the original (master) set of files.</p>
<p>The database was replicated from a master instance, this was simply a case of copying the data verbatim and updating the fields that related to file paths and any identifying information.</p>
<p>In my apps users do not have access to the administration panel, all site&nbsp;administration&nbsp;is provided vie the front end through a custom interface, Joomla is never exposed to the end user. An administrative account is provided that allows users to be created and managed, and other user groups can be created depending on the requirement of the app. Access to the admin panel is removed from within the subdomain.&nbsp;A data backup / export function is provided to allow users to manage&nbsp;their&nbsp;own backups, it also allows users to retain ownership of their data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The whole cloning process was handled through a custom written extension that allowed integration into the master site. I also integrated the process to utilise the excellent Akeeba subscriptions component to take care of the account creation and management.</p>
<p>My vision with the component was to enable me to easily monetize web ideas developed on the Joomla platform, but what started off as a way to replicate my initial idea so that it could be used by multiple users soon expanded into a second idea and then a third. It was pretty clear to me that there was as much value in the vehicle that I had developed to replicate the Joomla sites as in the sites themselves</p>
<p>By writing simple websites that function as applications, by&nbsp;implementing&nbsp;the subscriptions / cloning script &nbsp;I could allow users to subscribe to the use of their own dedicated site (app). Inspired by the Apple store where low cost high volume apps seem to be the current business model, it seemed like a good model to adopt.</p>
<p>I'm now in the final stages of releasing the first site (app) and am contemplating on whether to release my cloning script commercially. It would be great to earn some money from my hard work, but then it may also remove the edge from my advantage as no one has anything like this.&nbsp;Further developments in the pipeline include development of an app API to allow users to easily interface with their apps (sites) from third party code. For example a mobile device. This would involve exposing database data through the API so that it could be accessed remotely. This would actually be completely&nbsp;autonomous&nbsp;and function in isolation to the cloning script but would be a perfect&nbsp;accompaniment&nbsp;to the 'app' philosophy.</p>
<p>If you would be interested in a commercial version of my cloning component or the 'app' API, please comment below. If there is enough interest I may consider releasing them as commercial components available through the JED.</p>

I had perviously used SectionX on a few 1.5 sites and was very disappointed that it was never updated it for later Joomla versions. In the end I migrated the tutorials across to EasyBlog, but it was never quite the same.</p>
<p>Whilst recently updating a clients site I was pretty stoked to find that SectionX had been updated to work with the current Joomla versions. Great news! So I have installed it and re-enabled the old tutorials. All I need to do now is to go through the blogs and migrate any new posts back across to being a Joomla article. Stack Ideas offer a free plugin that claims to do this so I will give it a go and see what happens.</p>
<p>One thing that I will need to revisit is commenting for articles in the tutorials section. This was being handled by EasyBlog but will now have to managed by something like Komento. (another StackIdeas product).</p>
<p>Whilst it might seem like this blog post has been sponsored by StackIdeas, and I wont deny - they make some great stuff. There is one thing that they do not offer - a file manager. For this task I've decided to use the excellent Akeeba release system. I use a number of Akeeba products and like StackIdeas they are well built stable products that are well supported and simply work.&nbsp;The Akeeba release system allows easy versioning of downloads - perfect for software based releases.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2013/07/25/green-geeks.html">Green Geeks</a></h2>
	  <p>I have had a few of my larger sites hosted at Green Geeks for a number of years now. At one time I used to use them exclusively for all of my hosting, years ago the prices were good, and the service was great. However, over time the level of service seemed to drop massively and the number of issues that I&nbsp;experienced&nbsp;seemed to grow exponentially.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One issue that kept rearing it's head was unexpected server updates. The techs had a habit of making server configuration changes without any prior notice meaning that you would come into work and find that 100 out of your 200 sites had features that had stopped working. These changes were usually in response to server security compromises, and amazingly on some of these occasions there was even a root breach. Such changes were an absolute nightmare and sometimes would result in losing two days or more to update code to work with the new convoluted configurations. In the end I simply moved everything to another host.</p>
<p>Whilst this was easy for most sites, I have a couple of larger sites that simply were not an easy task to migrate. The sheer size of the sites meant days of FTP time to transfer the files. I simply kept putting the migration off until the inevitable happened.</p>
<p>Well that inevitable moment happend recently when the billing cycle was unable to renew as my credit card details had expired. Instead of emailing me to let me know so that I could update my details they simply flipped the switch and took the sites offline. The first I knew of it was receiving an email from an irate client saying that&nbsp;their&nbsp;service had been suspended. Great.</p>
<p>So after migrating the sites to the excellent <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=a6a4bd4b10c9">Digital Ocean</a> I cancelled the account. Good riddance Green Geeks. That was the end of the matter, or at least thats what I&nbsp;thought. Well, apparently not. On the next billing cycle I received a payment reminder. So I happily emailed them to explain that the account had been cancelled. I was told that I had to pay the outstanding amount and cancel my account. WTF? Great, it would appear that even on leaving them they had issues. I had issues with hosting, issues with billing and now issues leaving.&nbsp;I replied informing them that I considered that the matter was closed and that I would not enter into any further correspondance with them.</p>
<p>So I have been receiving a steady stream of reminder notices, which I have duly ignored, they have even added additional charges onto the reminder for late payment. The final culmination is that they are now threatening to send&nbsp;bailiffs&nbsp;around to collect the outstanding $30. Are these wankers for real?&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is typical of how Green Geeks now conduct business, if you report an issue they will make you feel as if you are the problem, the nice friendly service that they used to give when they first started has long since&nbsp;disappeared. They also massively oversell&nbsp;their&nbsp;server space, which is a contributing factor to the many issues that you will experience with&nbsp;their&nbsp;hosting.</p>
<p>My advice is to steer clear of Green Geeks, there are many cheaper and better hosts out there. If you really hung up on using Green Geeks due to the 'green' aspect. Make sure that you do some research before committing. They say that they are 300% wind powered, which implies that they exclusively use wind power, but the truth of the matter is that they use fossil fuelled power generation like everyone else, they offset this with the purchase of energy credits. (RECs). What they don't tell you is that these same RECs can also be sold on, usually for a profit.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2013/07/22/farcebook-dolphins-and-conundrums.html">Farcebook. Dolphins and Conundrums.</a></h2>
	  <p>Along with the recent site update I have also decided to junk the 'web technologies'&nbsp;moniker&nbsp;and revert to just the plain old 'DeeEmm' name. The reason for adopting the name in the first place was to try and leverage the DeeEmm name to generate some business from the hard earned reputation that I had garnered from providing free templates, mods and plugins for various web platforms.</p>
<p>For some reason, perhaps the free lovin hippy side of me, I decided to give away (yes GIVE AWAY!!) modifications and plugins for FREE!! This had a rather good outcome in that I managed to secure me quite a good reputation. Whilst others seemed to milking every and any opportunity I decided to try and undermine&nbsp;their&nbsp;cashing in by providing my mods for free. This ploy&nbsp;worked&nbsp;remarkably well, especially with the Boonex Dolphin platform, in fact so well that I still get enquiries for Dolphin work long after I opted to have nothing to do with it (some 2 or 3 years in fact!). The upshot of my free mods was that I received many many enquiries.&nbsp;But whilst I received many&nbsp;enquiries, the conversion rate was&nbsp;relatively&nbsp;low, in fact for every&nbsp;fifty&nbsp;enquiries only one would end up as a sale and not someone expecting free advice or help, not a very good conversion ratio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some reason most of those enquiries related to the Dolphin platform all ended up being little more than wishful thinking, it appeared that most of the enquiries that I received seemed to want everything that I could offer, but&nbsp;expected&nbsp;to pay more-or-less&nbsp;nothing&nbsp;for it. This is a&nbsp;phenomenon&nbsp;not&nbsp;experienced with other software platforms and I'm not 100% sure why.</p>
<p>I would like to say it is&nbsp;because&nbsp;of of a carefully&nbsp;considered&nbsp;business model where a less than a perfect software core is sold and then&nbsp;Svengali&nbsp;types swan along and sell you solutions to all of the inherent problems in the code. However I think that the reality is much worse than that.</p>
<p>Dolphin is just plain crap. It's a&nbsp;brilliant&nbsp;idea poorly executed. Web2 at its birth was a thing to behold. The opportunities that AJAX opened up was mind blowing. The modern web as you know it today was born of the flexibility that AJAX offered. Some of the ideas that were sold as Dolphin features were simultaneously heralded as the way forward&nbsp;across&nbsp;the web. There were many that had the same ideas when&nbsp;the&nbsp;realisation of what AJAX could&nbsp;achieve&nbsp;hit home. The natural&nbsp;progression&nbsp;was an&nbsp;organic&nbsp;reaction&nbsp;to the possibilities that asynchronous browser communications opened up. Unfortunately for Boonex they were not the only ones having these ideas.&nbsp;Everyone else could also see the opportunities that AJAX gave, but whilst everyone eventually realised these opportunities, Boonex are still trying to get them polished off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boonex's downfall was that they added ALL of these ideas as features simultaneously and&nbsp;implemented&nbsp;them very poorly. They simply did not have the resources to&nbsp;implement&nbsp;them all at the same time, but rather than select two or three of these features at a time and&nbsp;implement&nbsp;them well, they went ahead and added them all as features for the then upcoming Dolphin 7 release. What happened was that whilst they might have had a full feature set nothing worked.</p>
<p>So when I rebranded my website and sold myself to take advantage of the Boonex 7 boon I was hopeful of great things. Instead what I found was that the kind of people that were attracted to Boonex Dolphin were skinflint&nbsp;freeloaders who wanted me to fix&nbsp;their&nbsp;every whim for nowt. I helped a few of these nice folk out thinking that my good karma would be rewarded with some hard cash jobs but I must have been toking as nothing ever came of anything.</p>
<p>I even did a complete charity job of fixing up some chicks site who was doing a site for breast cancer awareness. I did a bunch of work and template mods getting her up and running without charging a cent thinking that I would at least get a nice&nbsp;testimonial&nbsp;out of it. Nah, didn't get Jack Shite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So with all of this success in mind I decided that I would stop using DeeEmm.com to promote the coding side of my business&nbsp;and&nbsp;simply retain it as a tech blog with the ocasional how&nbsp;to&nbsp;and download.&nbsp;Whilst&nbsp;still offering software services they would now have to be engaged via the main site for the business indau.com.au.</p>
<p>The result is that DeeEmm is now going to revert back to it's original purpose as a tech blog and outlet for my musings on Life the universe and everything software related. The other change that accompanies this is that the original Facebook page will also be changing. it will now be&nbsp;https://www.facebook.com/PragmatismInCode&nbsp;</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2013/07/19/site-update.html">Site Update</a></h2>
	  <p>Decided to update the site and freshen it up a little.</p>
<p>The template is now based on the popular Twitter boostrap template and some of the superfluous areas of the sites have been removed. The discussions area is now no more. I figure that I'm not developing commercial components any more so there is really no need for it, instead I will simply support each mod / tutorial through it's comment section.</p>
<p>Whilst on the subject of comments handling, I decided to stop using the excellent Komento and instead simply reply on the inbuilt comments system for EasyBlog. This is more than adequate and running a skinnier site is going to be much easier to manage.</p>
<p>There are numerous other changes, most of them minor and none really that noticeable so that's it for another year or so until the next update.</p>
<p>Now all I need to do is make some new posts.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/jomsocial/2013/07/19/running-cron-for-jomsocial.html">Running CRON for JomSocial</a></h2>
	  <p>To enable your JomSocial site to communicate with it's members you need to set a CRON job up to pop messages off of the mail queue. This is done by calling the following script. "http://yourdomain.com/index.php?option=com_community&amp;task=cron"</p>
<p>Normally this can be easily achieved by adding a cron via cPanel or whatever your flavour of web admin interface happens to be. If, like me, you are running a virtual or dedicated server you might need to add a CRON via the command line.</p>
<p>My particular flavour of linux happens to use the crontab function to run CRON tasks. To add a cron job its simply a case of running the following command</p>
<p class="caption"><strong><em>sudo crontab -e</em></strong></p>
<p>This will invoke the crontab editor which should then display the crontab file which initially is just a bunch of comments.</p>
<p>If you follow the link from the JomSocial mail queue page to their <a href="http://www.jomsocial.com/support/docs/item/720-setting-up-cron-job-scheduled-task.html">documents page</a>&nbsp;you will notice that they recommend the following commands for adding a CRON task.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>lynx -source "<a class="external free" href="http://www.domain.com/index.php?option=com_community&amp;task=cron" rel="nofollow">http://www.domain.com/index.php?option=com_community&amp;task=cron</a>" &gt; /dev/null </strong></em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>wget -O /dev/null "<a class="external free" href="http://www.domain.com/index.php?option=com_community&amp;task=cron" rel="nofollow">http://www.domain.com/index.php?option=com_community&amp;task=cron</a>" &gt; /dev/null&nbsp;</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>For some reason I could get neither of these to work.</p>
<p>Lynx was pretty easy - it wasn't installed, and I didn't particularly want to install it so I decided that wget was the way to go, but try as hard as I could I could not seem to pop any messages off of the mail queue. I tested the commands from the command line but still no go. I verified that the script was working by callling the URL directly in a browser and noticed that the message instantly popped off of the mail queue.</p>
<p>Next I tried to call the local file via php using the following command</p>
<p>/usr/bin/php5 "/var/www/mysite/index.php?option=com_community&amp;task=cron"</p>
<p>The only problem with this approach is that you cannot pass the post vars to the file, so the file runs but ignores the "?option=com_community&amp;task=cron" part. This means that only the index page is returned.</p>
<p>This led me to do a bit of further testing on the wget function. It turns out that this did exactly the same - it worked byt only returned the index page meaning that somehow it was ignoring the post vars. A little digging and I found that I can add an option to specify the post vars by using the <em><strong>&nbsp;--post-data</strong></em>&nbsp; option. Cool. Except that also did not work. :(</p>
<p>Interestingly whilst looking for info on the wget function I noticed that most people seemed to favour CURL instead of WGET when coding in PHP, so I thought I'd give it a try from the command line. Guess what. It worked first time.</p>
<p><strong><em>curl "http://mysite.com/index.php?option=com_community&amp;task=cron"</em></strong></p>
<p>Cool, so now I have a working command, so I have to do is make it work within CRON. First thing is to drop the response. This is easily achieved by routing the output to /dev/null, I also added 2&gt;&amp;1 to reroute any error messages into the land of unicorns. So putting together the whole thing looks like this...</p>
<p><strong><em>*/5 * * * *&nbsp;<strong>c</strong>url "http://mysite.com/index.php?option=com_community&amp;task=cron" &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</em></strong></p>
<p>This means that every 5 minutes CURL will call the URL and route the result to /dev/null </p>
<p>I added this line to my crontab file and to test set the interval to run every minute.</p>
<p>In addition to this I also checked that my Joomla email configuration was correct. I am using sendmail so I first checked that sendmail was installed. You can easily do this my issuing the command <em><strong>whereis sendmail</strong></em> If it is installed it will return the location of the sendmail executable.</p>
<p>If sendmail isn't installed, you can easily install it by issuing the following command&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>sudo apt-get install sendmail </strong></em></p>
<p><br />Next I checked my /etc/hosts file it should look like this:</p>
<p><em><strong>127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain HOSTNAME </strong></em></p>
<p>Where HOSTNAME is the hostname of your server. To find this out you can run the command <em><strong>hostname</strong></em></p>
<p>With everything set up you can invoke the sendmail configuration utility by running the command&nbsp; <em><strong>sendmailconfig</strong></em> and answering 'Y' to everything:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when I send some test messages I can see them appear on the mail queue as 'pending' then 5 minutes later they magically &nbsp;change to a green tick and get processed.</p>
<p>Much better then previously when they simply stalled after they got put on the mail queue.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2013/07/01/jomsocial-group-discussion-exploit.html">JomSocial Group Discussion Exploit</a></h2>
	  <p>Been getting spam for quite a while in a few of my JomSocial sites so decided to take a look into why.&nbsp;Spam messages were somehow being left by guest users even though guest access was disabled and permissions were set to members only for group discussions.&nbsp;After a short while I was easily able to replicate how to to do this myself.</p>
<p>So wanting to the the right thing and not publicly post the exploit for others to see and abuse I emailed JomSocial support with details of the exploit and how to fix it. After waiting for a while I got absolutely no response whatsoever. I then posted a message to their Facebook feed, same thing - absolutely no reply whatsoever. Pretty ironic considering that thier Facebook page is pretty active lately telling us what a great job they are doing improving JomSocial.</p>
<p>Hmmnnnn what to do?</p>
<p>So next I post a support thread on their forum. After a couple of weeks of not receiving any official reply I gave up any expectation of ever getting a reply and simply fixed my sites myself. I eventually received an email requesting that I give examples of the exploit, screen grabs and a whole bunch of other stuff that would take up heaps of my time. I politely declined saying that they had missed their chance but offering that they could engage me professionally if they wanted me fix their code. Not surprisingly there was no reply.</p>
<p>I left the issue at this figuring that as it had not really taken me much to figure it out, surely JomSocial would do the same. Well it seems that without me providing them with examples / screen grabs / server specs / etc / etc they simply chose to ignore the issue. Not exactly what I would call taking security seriously.</p>
<p>So having recently updated my sites I once again notice that I have received a bit of spam, obviously I have overwritten my fix. (oops) As I don't really want to run hacked code and would really prefer JomSocial to provide an official fix I've decided to force their hand into providing an update. So I decided to have a little fun - I decided to spam their demo site.</p>
<p>The initial round of comments were deleted pretty quickly, they simply said "<span style="color: #666666; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20px; text-align: left;">THIS IS AN EXPLOIT I CAN POST TO YOUR GROUP WITHOUT BEING A MEMBER". After the initial comments were deleted</span>&nbsp;I changed my comment to say "<span style="color: #666666; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 20px; text-align: left;">DO I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION NOW????". After a while the site was taken offline.</span></p>
<p>The exploit involves using a direct URL to edit a discussion post:</p>
<p><a href="http://demo.jomsocial.com/index.php/groups/editdiscussion?groupid=2&amp;topicid=9999">http://demo.jomsocial.com/index.php/groups/editdiscussion?groupid=2&amp;topicid=9999</a></p>
<p>(try it and see - if they are yet to fix it the exploit will still work)</p>
<p>As long as the topicid is greater than the highest topicid stored in the database the editor will display and allow you to edit this 'ghost' post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that there is no check to make sure the post exists before allowing you to edit it - This is Issue #1</p>
<p>Whats more amazing than this is that when the post is submitted there is no check in place to explicitly ensure that the author is not a guest. The post is submitted and accepted. - This is Issue #2</p>
<p>The check fails as it compares the current user which in the case of a guest is user 0 to the posts author which as the post does not technically exist is coincidentally also 0.</p>
<p>Whats also quite worrying is that the same philosophy for not explicitly checking for guest users is also employed just about everywhere else within the code. Admittedly it is not possible to call up the editor in the same manner but it would not surprise me to find that if I constructed direct a http request I could also post to other parts of the site whilst being a guest.</p>
<p>I decided to post the exploit here as I'm a bit annoyed in the way in which JomSocial handled the issue and the absolute lack of support in this area. I was very surprised to find that they had done absolutely nothing about it.</p>
<p>Lets see how long it takes them to fix the issue.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2013/01/22/go-yabba-daddy.html">Go Yabba Daddy</a></h2>
	  <p>Not being a very heavy traffic type of site DeeEmm.com has always been quite happy residing on a shared server along side the other similar sites that I run. My two heavy traffic sites reside on a dedicated server but there has never been a need for such extravagances here. That is, until just recently.<br /><br /><strong>Go Yabba Yabba!</strong><br /><br />I have a habit of bouncing between hosting plans so that i can get a better deal and have moved between several hosts before settling on GoDaddy. They offered the cheapest unlimited hosting and as I had domains and online storage registered there it seemed like a no-brainer. Before I moved I gave them a call to make sure that they supported Joomla and a few specific hosting requirements that I needed. The support guy was very helpful and reassured me that there were no account restrictions and the hosting could be configured as I required. Cool.<br /><br />So nearly a year goes by, with no major dramas. The support has been excellent when I have needed it and the sites are running much better then they did on my previous host (who had a habit of continually reconfiguring the servers in the name of 'security' which usually ended up breaking my site).<br /><br />Out of the blue just before Christmas I get an email from 'network violations' telling me that my account is in contravention of their hosting policy and will be taken down unless I immediately fix it. On digging a little further it transpires that as a couple of the sites I had hosted there have over 1024 files within a directory it was seen as being in contravention with their terms and conditions. They advised me to immediately change the site so that it did not have greater then 1024 files or folders in a single directory and then send them an email stating that I had removed the offending items, was in agreement to their rule of 1024 and would not do it again.<br /><br />WTF!?!<br /><br /><strong>I smell a rat!</strong><br /><br />I was majorly pissed off as one of the issues I asked about before committing was hosting limitations on their 'unlimited' plans. Well after doing some digging I found out that there is no such clause in their T&amp;C, hence the request to cut and paste a specific statement into an email. Obviously I refused.<br /><br />After some debate and moving up the food chain a few levels I ended up in a stalemate conversation with one of their managers who was not going to budge on their newly created 1024 rule and whilst I managed to get the deadline extended a little they were adamant that I had to address the file issue.<br /><br />There was no compromise on their behalf and I was fed a bullshite story about how my sites were affecting other domains on the shared hosting (quite amazing considering that neither site was actually live, the DNS records were still pointing at my previous registrar meaning that there was zero traffic to their servers).<br /><br />With lies and a complete lack of cooperation on behalf of GoDaddy I decided to vote with my feet and take my (considerable) business elsewhere. Their loss! I did however manage to get a parting shot by getting them to refund me for the three hosting plans that they miss-sold me. The ironic thing was that in the course of the discussions I had with them I asked if they would upgrade me to a VPS plan for free - which they declined. Not sure why as it was a fraction of the price of the three plans. Idiots.<br /><br /><strong>My Gain</strong><br /><br />Their loss has literally turned into my gain as I discovered <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=a6a4bd4b10c9" title="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=a6a4bd4b10c9">Digital Ocean</a> who offer basic VPS hosting from as little as $5 / month. I have now migrated all of my hosted sites over to a single VPS instance which is working absolutely flawlessly. The best thing is that should I need I can easily and instantly upgrade to a higher spec VPS with the click of a button.<br /><br />I'm going to carry on testing things out for a while and will probably move my two large sites across as it is much better value than I am currently getting.<br /><br />/DM<br /><br /></p>

	  <p>Something new is happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The past few weeks I have been rejigging all of my sites, services and applications so that they all now fall under the banner of my company <a href="http://indau.com.au" target="_blank">Indau</a>. The reason for this is that there was no direct correlation between each of the products. This autonomy also failed to leverage a very important commodity - diversity.</p>
<p>By associating all of my different products with my company, it demonstrates the diversity in the work that I do, and therefore work that the company is able to provide. It helps sell my services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reshuffle is partially due to expansion in a new direction, it also helps me to delineate paying projects from hobby projects. Not that hobby projects are without value, indeed the opposite is true. &nbsp;Whilst undertaking the reshuffle I also decided to revive &nbsp;my long suffering content management system. DMCMS. The reason for this is partially because I want to play with the fantastic tools on offer by the guys at Atlassian, but also because it deserves to live on.</p>
<p>After a quick review of the code with a fresh mind, the roadblock that prevented the version 1 release is readily apparent, the multi language support was weighing the code down and preventing progress. The first job is therefore to remove the bloat associated with the multi-language support and provide a functioning version 1 release.</p>
<p>To give DMCMS a new lease of life, and an identity of it's own I have registered <a href="DeeEmm.org" target="_blank">DeeEmm.org</a> so that it can reside in it's own space, with no distractions from the crap that goes on here at DeeEmm.com</p>
<p>It might take a few days to get things up and running but considering that there has been no movement on DMCMS in about 2 years I'm sure that should not be a problem.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2012/11/15/macbook-dies-in-freak-plane-accident.html">Macbook dies in freak plane accident</a></h2>
	  <p>The past week has been pretty painful as I have been without my trusty macbook. Unfortunately it died in what I can only call &nbsp;freak accident.</p>
<p>Last week whilst I was flying to visit a clients site the plane hit some turbulence. Now when I say <em>some</em> turbulence, you could probably translate that as the <em>worst turbulence I have ever experienced</em>. Not wanting to sound too blasé about such things; I fly quite a lot and being originally based in London I've experienced quite a bit of extreme weather whilst flying. Anyhow, before departing i did what I always do; put my mac into sleep mode, loaded it up in my trusty pull along samsonite laptop case and headed off to the airport. After going through check-in, stopping off for the obligatory coffee at the qantas lounge and boarding the plane I settled in to reading my book. (This week it is 'Existence' by David Brin).</p>
<p>Takeoff was pretty bumpy and the ride did not improve as we rose above cloud level, then about 15 minutes into the flight we hit <em>some</em> turbulence. I can only liken the turbulence to what it must feel like to be trapped inside an industrial washing machine, stuck inside of a cement mixer that is bouncing on the worlds biggest bungee. In fact, I'm not really sure if that is an adequate analogy, but I'm sure you get the gist.</p>
<p>Whilst such a ride is no issue for a skateboarding petrol head (I did at one point think of throwing my hands in the air and giving a 'whoop' or two), I've got to admit that the sound of the engines straining and the wings creaking was making the engineer side of my brain ask questions.</p>
<p>Eventually, after what seemed like half an hour or so the turbulence subsided and we landed safely. Unfortunately when I went to get my laptop bag from the overhead locker I found that it was open and that most of the contents had spilled out. I thought little of it until I got into work and discovered that my macbook would not boot back up.</p>
<p>Fortunately I use an online cloud storage solution to sync work between my macbook, iPad, the mac at my office and the mac at home so I had a relatively recent backup of my work which was just as well as no matter what I did I could not get the macbook to boot up. Eventually I did manage to get the system to boot and recovered the additional data but both the hard drive and hard drive controller are now cactus.</p>
<p>I would guess that putting the macbook into sleep mode rather than shutting it down completely may have been a contributing factor, and it is also possible that the hard drive may not have survived regardless, but it still remained a complete PITA that needed resolution.</p>
<p>After some consideration I decided that it was a good excuse to buy a new laptop. The macbook was a mid 2009 model and nearing the end of its useful life, it was already on it's second keyboard and third hard drive. As I travel a lot and have the use of a 27" iMac at work I decided to go small and have ordered an 11" macbook air with i7 2Ghz / 8Gig RAM and 512Gig SSD. Now I just have to wait for it to arrive, it's the longest 5-8 days of my life.</p>
<p>So I guess the moral of this story is remember to completely shut down your laptop before you fly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

	  <h2><a href="/jomsocial/2012/08/02/allow-guests-to-view-activity-stream-comments.html">Allow guests to view JomSocial activity stream comments</a></h2>
	  <p>I have recently migrated a site from Dolphin to JomSocial and needed to modify the way that the activity stream was displayed to visitors. By default the replies and likes of activity stream posts are only displayed to friends of the original poster. This means that the comments are very limited in their reach.</p>
<p>The overall effect of hiding activity stream comments and likes from guests is that this valuable activity is wasted.&nbsp;I wanted to show this activity to guest visitors so that they could see how active the site is. This in turn encourages them to join and hopefully encourages them to comment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, this may not be suitable for all sites, but in the case of this site, there was no activity that is 'secret' or 'private'; the activity stream is public viewable, and so should be the comments.</p>
<p>The modification you need to do this is pretty straightforward, it simply involves removing or commenting out two lines of code.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Modification Instructions</strong></p>
<p>open the following file...</p>
<p>components/com_community/templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE/activities.index.php</p>
<p>Look for the following line of code at around line 223</p>
<pre class="brush:php">&lt;?php if( $allowComment ) { ?&gt;

</pre>
<p>Replace it with the following</p>
<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;?php //if( $allowComment ) { ?&gt;
</pre>
<p>Next look for the following line of code at about line 263</p>
<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;?php } ?&gt;

</pre>
<p>Replace it with the following</p>
<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;?php //} ?&gt;

</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This simply comments out the lines. You can also opt to delete them completely if you wish.</p>
<p>Now your activity stream will display comments and likes to visitors as well as all members. The only caveat to this is is that if you are logged in it will display the 'reply' link but will not allow you to actually reply unless you are a friend of the original poster. What happens when&nbsp;you are not a friend of the original poster and you try to post a reply is that you will simply see a popup message box saying 'permission denied'. There are two ways that you can deal with this. These are as follows.</p>
<p>1. Change the message.</p>
<p>To change the message to something a little more meaningful you can do the following...</p>
<p>Edit the file components/com_community/controllers/system.php</p>
<p>At around line 1460 look for the following code...</p>
<pre class="brush:php">$objResponse-&gt;addAlert('Permission denied');
</pre>
<p>Simply change this message to something else - for example...</p>
<pre class="brush:php">$objResponse-&gt;addAlert('Only friends can reply');
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Allow non-friends to post.</p>
<p>If you want to let anyone be able to post to the Activity stream you can do the following...</p>
<p>The easy way...</p>
<p>Enable the following setting in the admin panel</p>
<p>components &gt; jomsocial &gt; configuration &gt; site &gt; &nbsp;activity &gt; allow everyone to comment</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hard way...</p>
<p>Find the same line mentioned above, but this time replace it with the following code...</p>
<pre class="brush:php">			$table =&amp; JTable::getInstance('Wall', 'CTable');
			$table-&gt;type 		= $act-&gt;comment_type;
			$table-&gt;contentid 	= $act-&gt;comment_id;
			$table-&gt;post_by 	= $my-&gt;id;
			$table-&gt;comment 	= $comment;
			$table-&gt;store();

			$cache	= CFactory::getFastCache();
			$cache-&gt;clean(array('activities'));

			$comment = CWall::formatComment($table);
			$objResponse-&gt;addScriptCall('joms.miniwall.insert', $actid, $comment);

			CFactory::load( 'libraries' , 'notification' );
			$params		= new CParameter( '' );
			$params-&gt;set( 'message' , $table-&gt;comment );
			$url			= 'index.php?option=com_community&amp;view=profile&amp;userid=' . $act-&gt;actor.'&amp;actid='.$actid;
			$params-&gt;set( 'url' , $url );
			$params-&gt;set( 'stream' , JText::_('COM_COMMUNITY_SINGULAR_STREAM') );
			$params-&gt;set( 'stream_url' , $url );


			CNotificationLibrary::add( 'profile_activity_add_comment' , $my-&gt;id , $act-&gt;actor , JText::sprintf('COM_COMMUNITY_ACITIVY_WALL_EMAIL_SUBJECT' ) , '' , 'profile.activitycomment' , $params );

</pre>
<p>Now anyone can reply to any post in the activity stream. Additionally anyone can also post directly to another users profile page. cool huh?!?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well I guess that this modification will not be for everybody, but if like me you have a community site this might just increase your activity.</p>

	  <p>At long last the Nautilus script is ready and available for public consumption.</p>
<p>I have now finished writing the script and the&nbsp;accompanying&nbsp;URL rewrite script and have extensively tested it on my own Dolphin to JomSocial migration. There are still a couple of minor bugs, but the script is functioning and is able to be used and has worked flawlessly in my own migration.</p>
<p>I have also updated the site to include all info correlated and in one place. You will now find all of the info related to Nautilus in the <a href="products/nautilus">products</a> section.</p>
<p>Installation is as easy as creating an instance of JomSocial in a subdirectory of your Dolphin site, copying the Nautilus script across and running it. You can then tweak your template and make whatever other modifications you need before committing to overwriting your old Dolphin installation.</p>
<p>Included is a rewrite script, which when coupled with a single call from your htaccess file will redirect all of the old Dolphin URLs to point at the new JomSocial locations. perfect for maintaining SEO rankings and preventing broken links to media shared offsite. You can easily enable permanent or temporary redirects, so it is easy to test before committing to permanently redirect.</p>
<p>Support is offered here on the site via the <a href="discussions">discussion</a> section. We are also happy to help you with JomSocial and Joomla so feel free to ask any questions that you may have.</p>
<p>As usual, all feedback is welcomed, as are any bug reports that you may have. Please also let us know of any success you have as well.</p>
<p>Good luck, and welcome to freedom from the fish script.</p>

	  <p>After restarting work on the migration script a few weeks back I have made great progress on getting it finished. I have gone through a few revisions and am now on version 0.10. The bugs are slowly getting addressed and the end is nearing.</p>
<p>The current version 0.10 is still in progress. I'm currently working on migrating the group forum posts into the discussion section of each group, but this is proving to be harder than originally anticipated. Still to go before I release the next version are to migrate articles, navigation structure and IBDW Spywall entries.&nbsp;I finally decided to migrate Spywall posts as the user profile pages look very bare. Plus the transition from old to new will be a lot smoother for members.</p>
<p>One major change is that I decided to flip the way that the migration is carried out. Originally I opted to install JomSocial and copy the Boonex files into a sub directory. However, after some thought I decided that it would be better to do the opposite. Now the migration is carried out by installing JomSocial into a sub directory. This means that you can get the whole migration up and running before going live. It also allows you to easily retain or switch between both sites by using htaccess rules.</p>
<p>The other major change is to move away from the corePHP Wordpress plugin and use EasyBlog. EasyBlog is much more user friendly and comparable with Wordpress on a basic level. OK so it doesn't have the plethora of plugins available to Wordpress, but on a community site this is probably a good thing. I do Have one JomSocial site that uses the corePHP Wordpress plugin, and whilst it works well, it is generally too complex for most users to get their heads around. If anyone really wants / needs a specific blogging platform I would be happy to write a custom script, although I would not do this for free.</p>
<p>I have addressed most of the issues with the previous release including the video and photo sections. All videos, both embedded and uploaded are now supported. Groups are migrated as are events, forums and groups. I have also added messages to the migrator. Although my own site does not really utilise the messaging function, there would be plenty that do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One nagging issue that I have not been able to fix relates to the forums. There is a bug that means a small amount of posts are not being converted from HTML into the BBcode that the forum uses. This means that the HTML tags display in the posts. I've stared at this particular issue for so long that I now have code blindness. It only happens to longer posts and almost seems to be an issue related to REGEX or database limitations. For the time being I've decided to focus on the outstanding issues, and leave this issue until later.</p>
<p>Once the basic migration script has been finished I will then look towards writing some code to allow htaccess redirects for the moved content. This is really important for SEO and retaining any rankings that you may have already amassed. The redirect script will utilise both htaccess rules and a custom php script to lookup the new data and return the correct link with a 301 (permanent) redirect. This will also allow any hot linked images or videos to still work.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm throwing all of the time that I can at getting the script finished as I want to migrate my remaining Dolphin site to JomSocial. Timeframe for the finished article including redirect script is probably still at least a month away, although a fully functional migration script will hopefully be closer.</p>
<p>Anyhows, Here's the changelog...</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2012/06/07/ipad-3-months-on.html">iPad 3 months on</a></h2>
	  <p>Been a while since I started using the iPad so thought I'd best post some progress.</p>
<p>If you have read the&nbsp;<a href="entry/general/ipad-versus-macbook-experiment">iPad versus MacBook experiment</a>&nbsp;post you would know that one of the objectives of the whole experiment was to see if I could use the iPad as a replacement for my laptop. Well, in short, I did actually manage it, albeit with a few restrictions.</p>
<p>I will start off by saying that whilst you can use your iPad for most things, there are a few things that are much easier on a proper computer. The biggest issue with the iPad for me was simply the user interface. It's great for most things but when you want to type there is nothing like a real keyboard. This is no big issue as you can use the standard apple bluetooth keyboard which works flawlessly. However, this leads not to another issue. There is no mouse.</p>
<p><strong>Mouseless</strong></p>
<p>To me not having a mouse is generally not an issue as I tend to use the keyboard wherever possible. I'm a staunch believer that as far as efficiency is concerned it's much quicker to hit a few keys than it is to reach over and use the mouse. The only issue is, that on the iPad, the common keyboard shortcuts do not exist. There's no 'cmd-tab', no 'home', no way to easily navigate between apps.&nbsp;This means that the only way to navigate is to use the touchscreen, which quite frankly sucks big-time as far as efficiency is concerned. This isn't a massive issue if you do not need to frequently change between applications, for example using a word processor but is a massive PITA if you are trying to code a website. If Apple can address the keyboard shortcut issue it would be a lot more useable.</p>
<p><strong>In the cloud</strong></p>
<p>As the iPad has limited storage, some kind of 'Cloud' or centralised file sharing is absolutely necessary for getting the most out of it, this is especially true if you are using the iPad for business.&nbsp;I have been a user of iDisk for quite a while. It was working really good for document storage and allowed me to easily share docs between all of my machines.</p>
<p>...Enter stage left iCloud.</p>
<p>Apple decided to replace it's iDisc service with iCloud, this has been rolled out over the past 9 months or so, with the end of life for iDisc happening next month. I've got to say as a cloud service iCloud sucks big time. Mostly as there is no webdav or FTP access, no way to manually organise the stuff that is stored there, no way to store files other then from inside an app that supports it. This is a big fail as far as I am concerned, okay for the home user using the apple suite of products but absolutely crap for business users such as myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now that iDisk is basically at its life end I needed to find a way of sharing docs between all of my machines.&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking around for a suitable cloud storage solution I decided to give<a href="http://www.godaddy.com/email/online-storage.aspx"> GoDaddy&nbsp;Online Storage</a> a try. They offered by far the cheapest solution, with a 100 gigs of storage weighing in at just under $30 per year, which is pretty much what most other hosts are charging monthly. Of course, with a price that cheap there had to be a catch: I found that the supplied sync tool was not very reliable and ended up resorting to manually synching my data using FTP. Not a massive issue, and for $30 a year not one that I am complaining about. I decide that as this was a bit of an experiment I would go with the cheap option and upgrade providers later on if I needed to.</p>
<p>It was actually good to reorganise my storage. Pretty much everything was stored on my laptop and backed up to a time machine. Using the iPad has forced me to move my storage online and change my workflow a little suit. Storing everything in online storage means that I can access it from any machine anywhere at any time, plus I get an extra level of redundancy as not only are my files backed up to my time machine, they are also now backed up online as well.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Apps - Accessing your stuff.</strong></p>
<p>To access your online storage you will need to have a suitable WebDAV / FTP client. I tried a few before I settled on using <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/air-sharing/id312686749?mt=8">Air Sharing</a>&nbsp;which had the cleanest interface and also included mail server integration which allows you to connect to your mail server and download message attachments directly to the iPad, a really handy feature. Air Sharing also allows direct access to your iPad from other devices on the network via a web based interface making it easy to quickly share files. You may also want to consider access to other services such as drop box, MobileMe or Google Docs, Air Sharing has support for a variety of providers but it's worth checking that it supports the ones that you use.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Apps</strong><strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Editing office files</strong></p>
<p>Unless you are happy with the apple suite of office type products you will need an app that is compatible with Microsoft office. Whilst Pages is okay, it does miss out some very basic formatting which makes it more or less completely incompatible with office docs. This is okay if you simple need to be able to open and read the document, but no good if you need to modify it as it will screw the document up. Fortunately help is at hand in the form of Quickoffice which does a much better job.</p>
<p>Quickoffice also incorporates the ability to download docs directly from your preferred cloud service provider and also provides direct access via a web client if you are connected to the same network. Unfortunately at this time it does not allow you to add custom WebDAV clients which means that you cannot add a client if it is not in the pre-defined list, unfortunately GoDaddy is not in the list.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My Impressions</strong></p>
<p>Overall having the ability to access files remotely and edit them will enable many to be able to use their iPad as a day to day office tool. Sure it might be a bit more clunky to use than a laptop but with the keyboard you can easily (and comfortably) use it to create and edit documents as you need. I find that being able to access my email and calendar is of greatest importance, and being able to take notes and refer back to them in meetings is the next most frequent thing that I do on a day to day basis, whilst I actually use another app for taking notes (more about that in a later post) it is easily achievable by using either the native notes application or Quickoffice.</p>
<p>The most important thing for me in being able to use the iPad on a day to day basis instead of the laptop was finding a suitable online storage provider so that I could easily share files between my computers and my iPad. Being a consultant, my work also allows me to be able to use the iPad for taking notes that I can then later type up when I am back in the office. In short I do not really need access to massive processing power on the road which has been a big factor in the success of using the iPad on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>Of course, it is no good for things like app development or PHP coding, for activities like these you will simply need to use a desktop or a laptop, but it is possible to use your iPad for making mods to sites, especially if you have got the correct apps, but more about that in another post.</p>
<p>After 3 months of using my iPad instead of my laptop, I can say wholeheartedly it is indeed possible. It will take a change in the way that you work, and a bit of reorganisation to your workflow, but when you are set up it is refreshing to be able to travel light and work simply. It was initially a bit hard for me to get my head around, and it wasn't until I had reorganised my complete storage to be online based that I could really take advantage of the iPad as a productivity tool.</p>
<p>The outcome of my three months trial is that instead of buying a new laptop I opted to buy a new iMac for my office instead.&nbsp;</p>

	  <p>The first in a series of articles documenting an experiment with an iPad, a consultant and a sense of adventure, If you are considering usig an iPad as a replacement for your laptop then read on...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some time now I've been toying with the idea of replacing my trusty but dating 13 inch MacBook Pro with the smaller lighter MacBook air, this is largely due to the size and weight saving but also as I have realised that I do not need masses of processing power when working away. If there's an intensve task to carry out I can usually plan to do this on the days that I'm in the office</p>
<p>Given that I've identified that I can get away with less processing power, you might find it ironic that the only thing that keeps me from indulging in actually buying the MacBook air is its comparatively lower performance; it simply does not seem like good value for money. The current MacBook air is approximately equivalent performance-wise to the MacBook pro that I want it to replace, but without the advantage of a 500Gb hard drive, and try as hard as I might, I simply cannot convince myself that the investment is a worthy one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having bought an iPad for development some time back, and then ending up never using it (it was hijacked by the powers that be and then later by my 2 year old), I recently decided to revisit the development of iPad apps for a new business venture. Rather than try to procure the existing iPad from my 2 year old, which would no doubt end up in tears (probably mine and not his), I decided to invest in the new version. The old iPad was a first generation device which did not have a camera, and the additional functionality would be necessary for the apps I planned</p>
<p>When I bought the first generation ipad, my initial impression was that it was rather limited and not possible to use day to day as a laptop replacement. Whilst this may still hold true for some tasks, having lived with both the iPad and an iPhone for some time, I now have a very different view. This is mostly as there are now many apps to fill in the gaps that existed when the ipad was initially launched, but also as it simply takes a while to figure out the true value of the ipad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So armed with the new iPad I've decided to conduct a bit of an experiment. I've decided to see if I can use the iPad to do all of my work on and leave the laptop in its bag. I will be posting progress updates to let you know what apps I have been using and how I have been overcoming any issues</p>
<p>I'm convinced that it is actually possible to make the iPad work for me as a day to day replacement for my laptop, and am looking forward to the challenge. Obviously the idea is for the iPad to be a productive tool and not hinder my workflow, so everything will be related to how it's use compares to using the laptop. I expect that this will show inadequacies in some areas such as ease of use but better in other areas such as portability.</p>
<p>For brevity I will split each observation / test / app / comparison into a separate post. I will also explain at this point that the client I am working for also grants me access to their computer system, so I have the ability to log in to thier PCs to use web based services via a browser and also have the ability to print. This means that I can access documents via dropbox or web mail to print if required. Again this may or may not align with your own usage expectations, but for my purposes works fine</p>
<p>Let the fun begin...</p>

	  <p>When recently migrating the DeeEm.com site I needed a way to be able to organise the tutorials section so that each tutorial was easily accessible. This meant creating an index of blog posts so that visitors could browse through each category so see if there were any mods that applied to their site. Whilst EasyBlog makes provision for listing category titles, there is no way to list the blog posts without additionally showing an intro portion from the post itself. This is achieved using the 'Latest Blogs' module, and whilst there is a setting to control the length of text displayed, even setting this to the minimum possible value, you will still display a couple of newlines in the output.</p>
<p>Whilst digging though the code to see if there was a way that I could modify the CSS or core code to force the list to display as I wanted, I discovered that there is a hidden value within the administration settings for the module that hides the intro text. The solution is to manually apply this value by directly editing the database table.</p>
<p>The value in question is for the 'introtext' variable: (<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; text-align: left;">Content be taken from</span>). This will only allow you to select between 'introtext' or 'main content'. What you cannot see is there is a third value 'Hidden'. I assume that this does not display, due to it having the value '-1', or at least it does not display in the browsers that I am using.</p>
<p>The solution is therefore very simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>using phpMyAdmin or your favourite MySQL client, browse to the #__modules table and search for the Latest Posts module you wish to edit (TIP - search for the module title + if you have just added the module it will be on the last page!). When you have found it, hit the edit button, and then scroll down to the 'params' section and search for the text "showintro":"0" . This may have the value of either 0 or 1 depending on the value of the setting in the admin section. Simply change the value to -1 and save it. Be careful not to change any of the other text.</p>
<p>Now you will notice that the intro text is gone, and the additional&nbsp;carriage&nbsp;returns are no longer visible.</p>
<p>One caveat is that if you edit any other settings within the admin section, it will overwrite this value and you will neeed to manually re-apply this fix.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/joomla%201.7%20how%20to's/2012/01/20/jcomment-to-easyblog-comment-migration.html">Jcomment to EasyBlog comment migration</a></h2>
	  <p>The recent migration from Joomla 1.5 to Joomla 1.7 left me without a comments system for the tutorials section of the site. Previously this was handled by Jcomment, a great component that allows you to easily add commenting to standard Joomla articles, its only drawback, is that the Joomla 1.7 version is still some way from release.</p>
<p>After having taken a look at various options, including several other commenting systems, I decided that the best solution would be to import the tutorial articles into EasyBlog, mostly as this would help keep some continuity on the site. The migration of the posts went flawlessly, as expected, but this still left me with the actual comments to migrate. I briefly considered a manual migration, but then discovered that there are actually quite a few comments on the site.</p>
<p>After a bit of digging around I discovered that EasyBlog creates a table that cross references the old article ID's to the new ID's. This is created during the migration process and the values are stored in the '#__easyblog_migrate_content' table. Perfect for migrating the missing comments across.</p>
<p>Using this table I was able to change the object_id in the original jcomments table to match the new post_id for EasyBlog. I simply ran the following SQL statement from within phpMyAdmin. (You will notice that I've made a copy of the original table into the table h0ahq_oldjcomments, just in case.)</p>
<pre class="brush:sql">UPDATE h0ahq_easyblog_migrate_content p, h0ahq_oldjcomments pp
SET pp.object_id = p.post_id
WHERE pp.object_id = p.post_id
</pre>
<pre><strong><br /></strong></pre>
<p>With the correct values assigned to the comments, I deleted all&nbsp;unnecessary&nbsp;fields (all fields except&nbsp;`userid`, `comment`, `date` and `object_id`) and then exported the table.</p>
<p>I then modified the SQL in a text editor as follows: I deleted the CREATE TABLE section and modified the INSERT statement as follows...</p>
<pre class="brush:sql">INSERT INTO `h0ahq_oldjcomments` (`userid`, `comment`, `date`, `newid`) VALUES
</pre>
<pre><strong><br /></strong></pre>
<p>Changed to</p>
<pre class="brush:sql">INSERT INTO `h0ahq_easyblog_comment` (`created_by`, `comment`, `created`, `post_id`) VALUES
</pre>
<pre><strong><br /></strong></pre>
<p>I then saved the file and using phpMyAdmin I imported the new comments into the database (again using phpMyAdmin).</p>
<p>Now all of the comments were under the correct posts but when viewing them I found that some of them had a left-margin set within an inline stye causing the comment to shift over to the right side of the page. After a &nbsp;bit of digging, this transpired to be&nbsp;because&nbsp;there was some data missing from the database. For each entry there are two fields set which relate to the comments location within the comment stream, this is needed EasyBlog allows nested comments. My quick import simply assigned zero values to these fields confusing the script as to where the comments should sit within the comment stream.</p>
<p>The fields should function as follows - Assuming that all comments are sequential and not nested, on the first comment the values for the two fields lft and rgt will be 1 and 2, the next comment will be 3 and 4, and so on...</p>
<p>Rather than get technical and write a PHP script to do the job properly, I decided to manually add the values. I simply gave all comments the values 1 and 2 for the fields lft and rgt respectively (via phpMyAdmin). I then manually edited the posts where there were more then one comment so that the subsequent posts had the values, 3&amp;4, 5&amp;6, etc. I used the following SQL to find the duplicate entries:</p>
<pre><strong>SELECT `post_id` FROM `h0ahq_easyblog_comment` GROUP BY &nbsp;`post_id` HAVING &nbsp;(COUNT(`post_id`) &gt; 1)</strong></pre>
<p>Fortunately there were not too many posts with multiple comments.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2012/01/18/black-wednesday.html">Black Wednesday</a></h2>
	  <p>If you are a regular internet user, or even a regular user of other more traditional media, you probably couldn't fail to be aware of the blackout of several well known websites. Amongst the most reported was the blackout of Wikipedia. It's actions receiving a lot of media coverage here in Australia on the radio and television, coverage that was no doubt echoed around the rest of the globe...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The black out of Wikipedia, and several other high traffic sites such as O'Rielly, WordPress Reddit and Cheezburger, is in response to the proposed SOPA (Stop Online Piracy) / PIPA (Protect Intellectual Property) Acts. These Acts have respectively been proposed by the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, and are considered by most to be ill conceived and not needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the intent of SOPA / PIPA is to prevent online piracy and sites such as The Pirate Bay from operating, the crux of the issue with the proposed acts is the apparent lack of due process laid down in their enforcement, resulting in the ability to be able to misuse the acts for purposes other than their original intent. This is of course very bad news.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Digital Millenium Copyright Act</strong></p>
<p>Application of the existing DMCA (Digital Millenium Copyright Act) has already seen many instances of the existing law being liberally applied without following any formal due process, resulting in unfounded Cease and Desist notices being issued and major inconvenience to those on the receiving end. The proposed SOPA / PIPA acts far exceed the scope of the existing DMCA Act, and without a formal process for their application have every chance of eventually morphing into a set of laws that bear no relevance to the original intent of the acts.</p>
<p>If like me, you do not live in America, you may think that the proposed SOPA / PIPA acts do not affect you. Well think again. There are several precedents where those falling foul of the DMCA in Australia have been extradited to America to face charges, resulting in custodial sentences. Admittedly, in each case the sentence was befitting of the crime, but it goes to show that the proposals do in fact have a very far reaching nature, and that operating a warez or torrent site in Australia, on Australian servers does not exclude you from might of American law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst stories of extradition of individuals under the DMCA are relatively uncommon, action against service providers is not. The easy target for enforcers of the DMCA is to target the hosts of infringing sites or the service providers of those guilty of dealing in the infringing data, the results of this are usually very effective, resulting in stopped services and almost instant solutions.&nbsp;The big issue with the application of the existing DMCA (act) is of course that the effected users have no participation in the process at all, it is a case of guilty until proven innocent. Basically if your site is taken down, it is up to you to engage lawyers, or enter into lengthy debates with your ISP to reverse the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So why is there a need for the new acts?</strong></p>
<p>Like many others, I think that the new acts are mostly in response to the corporate giants feeling sore for the loss of sales to online piracy, the acts do not really protect the intellectual property of the 'little man' at all. Being a software provider I have been the victim of piracy myself, where others have taken my work and passed it off as their own. My attempts at trying to get the data removed from the offending sites by issuing a formal request was met with disdain, and short of employing expensive lawyers to act on my behalf (not really feasible for a $20 CMS extension) there was very little I could do.&nbsp;Generally under the DMCA, a representative of the copyright owner will contact the provider and make a similar request, this is long before a ceast and desist notice is raised, but with the weight of a large company behind such requests, most ofter this request is executed unchallenged.</p>
<p>Ironically enough, I have also been on the receiving end of such a situation. i designed some t-shirts for vdubber.com (a VW enthusiasts website that I run), and offered them for sale on the site through zazzle. The t-shirts contained the site's logo and a slogan which included the name of the auto manufacturer - <em>'www.vdubber.com - Next generation VW community'.</em> One day whilst browsing through the site I noticed that the t-shirts were no longer available in store. There was no notification from Zazzle, no opportunity to put forward a contrary argument, they were simply removed. I then subsequently found out that an independent representative acting on behalf of VW had contacted them and asked for the t-shirts to be removed, which Zazzle had done without argument. Such is the perceived power of the DMCA.&nbsp;Needless to say, I no longer use Zazzle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So what is the solution?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Hack, the current affairs program hosted by Triple-J radio here in Australia, had a reportage on the new acts and invited comment from the public. The general consensus seemed to be that the corporate giants were the main driving force behind the acts, and that they were in response to lost sales. Interestingly, many agreed that the solution was simply for these companies to change their business models to suit the new digital marketplace. If products were made more accessible, easier to buy and at more reasonable prices, the effect would be that many would favour purchasing these instead of pirated versions.&nbsp;A point in case raised by one listener was Adobe's products. In America one product retailed in their online store for $699, whereas in Australia the same product was Over $1000. Adobe had also taken great measures to ensure that Australian customers could not purchase the product through the american online store. (I know, as I've previously tried).</p>
<p>Digital music is probably the biggest culprit for piracy. But the shift from tangible goods towards digital goods has not really seen an accompanying shift on the business models of music providers. Steve Jobs has done a lot towards this transition with the iTunes store, but the prices are still too high for many, and the lure of free music from torrent sites is simply too great.</p>
<p>Online music today has no physical aspect, there are no manufacturing costs, no distribution costs, virtually no retail overheads &nbsp;(online hosting excepted) and more importantly it has exposure to a much wider audience. Many argue that online music should be much more affordable, and that reducing the cost and making it easier to download would see a rise in sales. But this requires a change in business philosophy, a change that still appears to be some way off. Is it greed? is it simply that corporate executives simply do not 'get' the internet? Who knows. One thing is for certain, and that is that the new SOPA / PIPA acts are not the way to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Censorship</strong></p>
<p>The stance taken by many in the blackout campaign, is that the new SOPA / PIPA acts will enforce its wielders with the power to censor, a direct contravention of the first amendment, and something that most patriotic Americans feel very strongly about. The introduction of similar censorship measures in countries such as Thailand has been met with a lot of discussion relating to the rights of website owners to freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Interestingly, censorship in Thailand often relates to items that directly contravene Thai law, for example certain content relating to their King. Similarly to America, both ISP's and individual's can be held accountable. So considering that&nbsp;Thailand does indeed have extradition treaties in place with both America and the UK, and the magnitude of offences in relation to insulting the King. Is it therefore reasonable for Thailand to expect extradition of any American citizens found to be in contravention of Thai law for posting something that offends their King? If you are American you will no doubt say a great big emphatic NO!</p>
<p>So why should there be one law for Americans, and a different one for everyone else? In short, there should not. Stop the SOPA / PIPA acts now by showing your support.</p>

	  <p>You would think that working on websites all the time i would have an up to date site myself, the problem is, that by the time I've finished working on everyone else's stuff, i don't really feel like working on my own.&nbsp; Contrary to popular belief, there is actually a life outside of the internet (it's true :D ), and whilst it can be really hard to drag myself away from the monitor, I make a point of doing other (real and tangible) stuff wherever I can. This is especially true since having children. The upshot of this is that time is at a premium and my own sites suffer, nothing gets updated.</p>
<p>So with new abandon, I'm setting out to update DeeEmm.com. It's been long overdue, but the time has come to give the site a bit of a spruce up. i did take a bit of a look at this some time back, but as the site is still running from the old 1.5 version, the main reason for wanting to update was to upgrade to the newer 1.7 code. Unfortunately the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/migration-a-conversion/joomla-migration/11658" title="jUpgrade">jUpgrade</a> code prescribed by Joomla for migrating to 1.7 did not seem to want to work, however, there is now a new version, and the test migration I performed last night worked flawlessly.</p>
<p>At this time I'm planning to migrate the info over, spruce up the template a little, and maybe (maybe), add a few new features in.</p>
<p>One component that I've been using quite a bit on other sites is <a href="http://stackideas.com/easyblog.html" title="EasyBlog">EasyBlog</a> from <a href="http://stackideas.com/" title="StackIdeas">StackIdeas</a>. This will probably see it's way into the update as it's much easier to use than publishing these posts via the Joomla interface. Plus, it comes with all of the bells and whistles that you would expect from an up to date blogging platform.</p>
<p>In the past i've advocated the use of <a href="http://www.corephp.com/joomla-products/wordpress-for-joomla.html" title="wordpress for joomla">Wordpress for Joomla</a> by<a href="http://www.corephp.com/" title="corephp"> corephp</a> for blogging needs on the Joomla patform. I even used this in my Dolphin to Joomla migrator. But whilst WordPress for Joomla is a great way to integrate the familiar blogging platform into your site, EasyBlog is actually more feature rich and believe it or not, much easier for a novice to use, which in my opinion is the right thing to have when trying to get your non tech savvy site members to start blogging.</p>
<p>StackIdeas also have a couple of other great products, namely <a href="http://stackideas.com/sectionex.html" title="SectionX">SectionX </a>- a great (free) component for organising articles - perfect for the tutorials section here ;) and EasyDiscuss, a Yahoo answers type of Q&amp;A plugin, which may, or may not make an appearance. I'm keen to replace the forums with it, but at the moment I'm not 100% decided.</p>
<p>So as you can see, there's things afoot here at the DeeEmm office, things that you will hopefully be seeing on the very near future.</p>
<p>Watch this space.</p>

	  <p>If you are new to Joomla / JomSocial there are a few handy things to know...<br /><br />Joomla 'Modules' are similar to Dolphin 'Blocks' you can change module types <br />and positions in the admin panel. Modules are available for many extensions to <br />help display data FROM the extension on your site. eg latest forum posts. <br /><br />Module positions are set in the template. To view available module positions <br />you can add the following to the end of the URL ?tp=1 You will need to also <br />enable this in the template for the module positions to be displayed.<br /><br />Menus are also controlled by modules, so to add a menu you need to add a menu module to <br />the relevent module position. Check out the standard modules to get an idea of <br />how they work. This means you can have multiple menus.<br /><br />Extensions are similar to dolphin modules. You can search for extensions in the <br />'JED' (Joomla Extensions Directory). Most Jooma extensions are free. <br />Make sure you select extensions that are compatible with your installation <br />version. Also, read the comments as they most often give a good idea of the <br />provenance of the extension.<br /><br />As JomSocial is a joomla extension, to get other extensions to interact with it, <br />it might be necessary to install plugins. So when looking for extension, check <br />to see if they are JomSocial compatible. <br /><br />For example. Installing the kunena JomSocial plugin allows the kunena posts to <br />be included in the JomSocial activity feed. <br /><br />To install an component / extension. <br /><br />1/ Log INTO the admin control panel at http://yoursite.com/administrator <br />2/ Browse to extensions &gt; extension manager<br />3/ Click the 'choose file' button in the 'upload package file' section, <br />4/ Browse to the extension package (it should be a zip file) <br />5/ Hit 'upload &amp; install' button<br /><br />The Extension will automagically be installed. <br /><br />Check the 'Components' menu as there should now be a link to administrate your new component.<br /><br />If the installation fails it will tell you with an error message.<br /><br /></p>

<p>We recommended that you consider installing the AKEEBA Backup extension to manage taking <br /> backups of your site. This can also be automated by the use of a cron job.<br /> <br /> If you intend to migrate your forums you will need to install the KUNENA <br /> extension. This is a mature forum that fully integrates with JomSocial and is <br /> comparable in features and operation with phpBB or SMF<br /> <br /> The Stack Ideas EasyBlog extension is a very capable blog component. As with some of the other components, it is not free, but worth the small amount it costs.</p>

	  <p>If you are one of those visitors who is expectantly waiting for the release of the Dolphin to Joomla migration script, you will be happy to know that things are moving along nicely and the script will be released before the end of the month. In preparation for this imminent release I have started to prepare the documentation for the installation, including the scope of operation and the requirements for getting it up and running.</p>
<p>The documentation will be provided in a series of articles in the tutorials section which will walk you through the whole process in a step by step manner. It will also cover the setting up of Joomla and Jomsocial, as well as providing installation help for the required third party modules.</p>
<p>The first of these articles is now available to view and is an introduction that covers what you can expect from the migration. To view the article visit...</p>
<p><a href="resources/tutorials/60-dolphin-to-joomla-migration.html">http://www.deeemm.com/resources/tutorials/60-dolphin-to-joomla-migration.html</a></p>
<p>Long time dolphin frustratee's will be pleased to learn that the migration utilises the excellent Wordpress script for the blogging component, and includes the world class forum script 'Kunena'. Photo's videos, events, messaging, profile customisation including widgets and the mandatory activity wall are all standard core components in JomSocial. Mix this up with a few free modules from the Joomla Extensions Directory and you have a site to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>So if are getting impatient, why not take a read through the first article, and maybe even install a test installation of Joomla and Jomsocial to have a play about and familiarise yourself with how it works.</p>

	  <p>If like me, you have had enough of your Boonex Dolphin website, and want to change to a more stable platform, you will need to migrate your existing database information and copy files across to work on a new script. To successfully do this, the existing data will need to be modified so that it functions with the new script, and files changed to suit. You will also need to set up the new script and modify it to suit your site. This means lots of tweaking, template changes and honing of site settings will be required before things are set up to your liking.</p>
<p>As I am providing and promoting the use of my migration script to migrate your site to use the JomSocial platform, I decided to write up a few articles to help make the transition a little smoother.&nbsp;As with any script, there is a steep learning curve required to be able to quickly use and manage a new script, and to make this easier I will provide a step by step guide to walk you through how to quickly get things up and running.</p>
<p>The migration process is quite involved and requires the possession of a number of skills. For this reason it will not be something that everyone will be able to perform. I advise everyone to read the notes at the top of the migration script to ensure that you fully understand the process. The script itself is also commented and should be easy enough for most novice coders to understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
<p>The following items will be migrated by the migration script</p>
<ol>
<li>Users</li>
<li>Standard user profile info</li>
<li>Avatars</li>
<li>Mail messages</li>
<li>Friends</li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Photos</li>
<li>Videos</li>
<li>Forums</li>
<li>Groups</li>
<li>Blogs</li>
<li>Articles</li>
<li>Sites</li>
<li>Spywall info</li>
<li>IBDW Spywall data</li>
<li>Modzzz Points data</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
<p>As everyone's dolphin installations will be different, it is impossible to cater for all modifications and setups, and so migration will be limited to standard modules plus the additional custom modules listed above. What this means in practice is that if you have a modified site, some data may not be transferred. It is of course possible to cater for custom or non-standard modules, but this will require custom work.</p>
<p>At the time of publishing, the following limitations are noted</p>
<ol>
<li>Modules not listed above will not be migrated</li>
<li>Only standard Dolphin tables will be imported. Modified tables may not work.</li>
<li>Old passwords will not work. All user passwords will need to be reset via the password reset function.</li>
<li>There is an issue for converting HTML to Kunena BB code in long forum posts. This is a REGEX limitation and a workaround is currently being devised</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-step</strong></p>
<p>The migration process follows a set procedure, this is outlined as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup existing site files and database.</li>
<li>Download Joomla + JomSocial + required 3rd party components</li>
<li>Create a directory in your webroot called 'joomla'</li>
<li>Copy Joomla files to this folder</li>
<li>install Joomla using existing database credentials</li>
<li>Install JomSocial component using Joomla integrated installer</li>
<li>Install 3rd party components using Joomla integrated installer</li>
<li>Change some administration and template settings</li>
<li>Run the migration script</li>
<li>Set up the site.</li>
<li>Once happy you can then copy the contents of the Joomla folder to the root folder</li>
</ol>
<div>(Please refer to the comments in the migration script for more detailed instructions)</div>
<p>The migrator will automatically read the old database information, convert it and use it to populate the new database tables. The script will also physically move existing photo and video files into the correct directories for the Joomla script. It can optionally also delete the old Boonex data once it is finished.</p>
<p>Included with the script is a file called rewrite.php which allows you to retain your old dolphin style links and rewrite them&nbsp;using htaccess&nbsp;to point at the new Joomla locations. You can also issue a 302 redirect to permanently redirect search engines to the new location.&nbsp;</p>

	  <p>It's very nearly here. The Dolphin 'Fish Script' to JomSocial migration script is just around the corner.</p>
<p>To continue on with the theme so affectionately adopted by Boonex, I have decided to give the script a nautical name. So with respect to Jules Vernes <em>Twenty thousand leagues under the sea</em> I have named it the Nautilus.</p>
<p>For those of you who have been patiently awaiting me to pull my finger out and get the script written, you will be happy to learn that I only have a few more tables to migrate and it will be finished (after testing of course).</p>
<p>So, just to raise the tension a little, and build the anticipation (in the best Boonex style - LOL)</p>
<p>Watch this space...</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2011/06/09/finish-what-you-started.html">Finish What You Started...</a></h2>
	  <p>I had to laugh to myself when I took a look at the Boonex website earlier today. True to form, and as predicted by me many months ago. It would seem that Boonex are preparing to move on from their Dolphin 7 script and replace it with... you guessed it... <a href="http://www.boonex.com/n/sundance-the-first-dolphin-8-2011-06-06">Dolphin 8</a>.</p>
<p>As predicted, Dolphin 8 will not share functionality with the earlier version rendering all purchased modifications, templates etc useless. Those choosing to update to the new version will be at the mercy of the vendors when it comes to updating and it is likely that many vendors will use this to force users into purchasing products again. This was certainly my experience when I upgraded from Dolphin 6 to Dolphin 7.</p>
<p>Another issue that I faced when I upgraded was that the URL schema was changed between D6 and D7, this was a major headache as it had a huge effect on my sites SEO rankings, and was something that was not fixable. It would not surprise me to find that Boonex will change the URL schema again on the new update.</p>
<p>The dolphin community are anxious with the news of the upgrade, especially those members that have been around long enough to have experienced this before. Amusingly Boonex seem to be using similar excuses about D8 being the next best thing, and so much better than the last best thing. Quite rightfully there is a lot of frustration amongst the older community members.</p>
<p>The same question relating to fixing the existing bugs is also being asked, and the same answer is being given that was given to Dolphin 6 users, namely that D7 will continue to be supported in parallel to D8. Well sorry Boonex. I'm going to have to call B$ on that one. I was one of those frustrated D6 users. Boonex's reply thread's title say's it all... '<a href="http://www.boonex.com/n/finish-what-we-started-or-move-on">Finish What We Started or Move On</a>' I will leave it up to you to decide on what will happen there.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I did a Google for 'Dolphin' to see what the discussions were out in the web community, and still there, in the top search rankings are the words 'Boonex is a Scam!!'. It seems some things will never be forgotten, and the more I look at the way that Boonex operate, the harder it is to ignore such sentiments. Those newer Dolphin users should take heed to some of the bad press that Dolphin gets, there is actually some credence in those words.</p>
<p>Whilst I was poking around the Dolphin site I couldn't help but notice that it bared an uncanny resemblance to the old expertzzz site, it made me wonder if there had been some role changing over at the Boonex camp and they had reinstated someone from a past era. If my memory serves me correct, this would be the same person who was responsible for the bad coding of previous dolphin versions which in turn was one of the big selling points for upgrading to D7.</p>
<p>Ironically the same selling point is being applied to D8 - an improved codebase, with newer features, replacing the old (outdated / bad / in need of repair) codebase of D7. LOL. It seems to me (and I have stated this before) there is a severe lack of project management over at Boonex. The goal posts constantly change, and the code gets changed for no reason other than someone wants to change it. Admittedly, D7 is far from being a great piece of coding, and to be truly competitive needs a complete rewrite, but the way that they fail to manage their business is laughable. That is of course, unless such moves are part of their business strategy.</p>
<p>The lastest post <a href="http://www.boonex.com/n/a-more-modular-dolphin-dolphin-studio-screenshot-2">A More Modular Dolphin</a>. Dolphin Studio Screenshot! shows some of the groundbreaking new development thinking that has gone into D8. (LOL) But this itself has already caused some conjecture about whether it is an actual screenshot of the new code in action, or simply a created image. The answer is very telling indeed. The comment made abut D8 that Boonex could possibly a competitive product to Drupal literally made me ROFLMFAO. The biggest change is the same change that Boonex always seem to sell; a change in the base philosophy of how the web works. Well, suffice to say. Whilst Boonex try to reinvent the wheel, the rest of the web will move on at it's normal pace leaving Boonex lagging some paces behind.</p>
<p>Looking back, it's not too far off of a year ago that I made <a href="home/189-just-for-fun.html">this post</a> about revisiting Boonex two years from the date that I decided I'd had enough with Dolphin, it's bugs, the bad support and the lack of integrity displayed by their developers. And whilst it's pretty amusing that a year down the track it's contents are still holding true. it is of no real surprise to read the posts about D8, and how it's being handled. I still feel sorry for those sucked in by the hype, but there is some hope. <a href="news/209-sneak-peek-at-dolphin-to-jomsocial-migration-script.html">Migrate to Joomla</a>. LOL</p>

<p>Occasionally I need to use icons in an application or website, generally I favour the 'standard' stock icon sets like the fantastic and widely used&nbsp;<a href="http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/" title="http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/">FamFam Silk</a> icon set or <a href="http://somerandomdude.com/projects/bitcons/" title="http://somerandomdude.com/projects/bitcons/">Bitcons by Somerandomdude</a> which I utilised in earlier versions of DMCMS. but recently I needed a larger icon set to create buttons for an admin panel that I was putting together for a web based application.</p>
<p>After the usual google search I stumbled across <a href="http://icons.mysitemyway.com/" title="http://icons.mysitemyway.com/">http://icons.mysitemyway.com/</a> which offer 66 different themed icon sets each based on the same basic pictographs. Each icon set is divided into several categories, such as business or social media and can be downloaded separately. In total there are 128,743 royalty free icons and clipart images available.</p>
<p>The quality and variety of each icon set is fantastic and diverse enough that there is a style available to suit pretty much most application and website designs. I managed to find a 'safety' themed icon set called <a href="http://icons.mysitemyway.com/category/yellow-road-sign-icons/" title="http://icons.mysitemyway.com/category/yellow-road-sign-icons/">yellow road signs</a> that perfectly suited the application I am working on. But what was even more impressive was that the icons set included enough of a variety of icons, that I managed to cover every single icon type that I required, without having to create additional icons myself.</p>
<p>A big thumbs up to mysitemyway for their generosity in giving these icons away, if you need an icon set in the near future, be sure to go check them out. I will definitely be considering them for future apps that I write. A big 10/10 from me.</p>

	  <p>We have already discussed how to hide template elements from logged in members in <a href="resources/tutorials/59-joomla-16-how-tos/211-hide-template-elements-from-members-logged-in-users.html" title="http://www.deeemm.com/resources/tutorials/59-joomla-16-how-tos/211-hide-template-elements-from-members-logged-in-users.html">this tutorial</a>, but what about if we wish to only display template elements on certain pages.</p>
<p>Taking the same example used in the previous tutorial, we can easily modify the code so that it is displayed only on the home page.</p>
<p>Here is the code we used to hide template elements from logged in users</p>
<pre>&lt;?php <br />$user = JFactory::getUser();<br />if($user-&gt;guest ) : ?&gt; <br />...<br />...<br />&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;<br /></pre>
<p>We can expand this simple method to only display the template elements on specific pages. This is done by checking the item ID for the page like this...</p>
<pre style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 15px; border-left-width: 5px; border-right-width: 1px; border-top-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #f6f6f6; font: normal normal normal 1em/1.5 'Courier News', monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border-color: #999999; border-style: solid;">&lt;?php <br />$user = JFactory::getUser();<br />if($user-&gt;guest &amp;&amp; JRequest::getInt('Itemid') == 101)) : ?&gt; <br />...<br />...<br />&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;<br /></pre>
<p>To find the item ID for the page, simply check the value for the ID column in the article manager, and substitute this in the statement above.</p>

	  <p>If you are using a custom template and want to control how it is displayed, you may need the following mod.</p>
<p>This quick easy modification will allow you to only show some page elements to guests. I made this modification to hide the slideshow in Gobbers Themes 'Comenian' template, but it can easily be adapted for other elements on other templates.</p>
<p>Basically we need to wrap the element we want to hide in some php code that checks if the user is logged in. If they are not, then the element is shown.</p>
<p>Open the templates main index file, you can find this in the template directory, in this case it is</p>
<p><strong>/templates/<span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">comenian</span></span>/index.php</strong></p>
<p>The index.php file is the file that generates the main template layout, simply browse to the template you wish to alter.</p>
<p>Open index.php in your favourite editor, and find the element you wish to hide, in this case it is the slideshow. It can be any piece of code in the template. A tip here is to use your browser and the view code / DOM inspector (such as firebug) to find the code you wish to hide, and then look for it in the index.php file.</p>
<p>Here's the code we wish to hide for the comenian template</p>
<pre>&lt;div id="slideshow-w"&gt;<br />  &lt;div id="slideshow"&gt;<br />  &lt;img src="templates/&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;template ?&gt;/images/slide1.jpg" alt="image1" /&gt;<br /> &lt;img src="templates/&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;template ?&gt;/images/slide2.jpg" alt="image2" /&gt;<br />  &lt;img src="templates/&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;template ?&gt;/images/slide3.jpg" alt="image3" /&gt;<br />  &lt;img src="templates/&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;template ?&gt;/images/slide4.jpg" alt="image4" /&gt;<br />  &lt;img src="templates/&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;template ?&gt;/images/slide5.jpg" alt="image5" /&gt;<br /> &lt;/div&gt;<br /> &lt;/div&gt;<br /> &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"&gt;<br /> var $j = jQuery.noConflict();<br /> $j(document).ready(function(){<br />  $j("#slideshow").slideshow({<br />  pauseSeconds:&lt;?php echo $pause ?&gt;,// 5,<br />  height:&lt;?php echo $hauteur ?&gt;, //469,<br />  fadeSpeed:&lt;?php echo $fadespeed ?&gt;,// 0.5,<br /> width:&lt;?php echo $largeur ?&gt;, //950,<br />  caption: false<br />  });<br />  });<br />  &lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>Insert the following code before the elements you wish to hide</p>
<pre style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 15px; border-left-width: 5px; border-right-width: 1px; border-top-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #f6f6f6; font: normal normal normal 1em/1.5 'Courier News', monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border-color: #999999; border-style: solid;">&lt;?php <br />$user = JFactory::getUser();<br />if($user-&gt;guest ) : ?&gt; <br /></pre>
<p>The first line is a class call that loads the class required to generate the variables we need to check. The second line is the check itself.</p>
<p>Now insert the following code after the elements you wish to hide</p>
<pre><span style="font-family: monospace; ">&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;</span></pre>
<p>The two commands form a basic if statement, if the statement is true, the code in between will be executed.</p>
<p>To make the code only execute if the statement is false - ie only display for logged in users, simply add an exclamation mark before the logic like this...</p>
<pre><span style="font-family: 'Courier News', monospace; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap; ">if(!$user-&gt;guest ) : ?&gt;</span></pre>
<p>You can also test for other conditions here as well, such as only displaying the code on specific pages. To find out how to do this, <a href="resources/tutorials/59-joomla-16-how-tos/212-show-template-elements-on-selective-pages.html" title="http://www.deeemm.com/resources/tutorials/59-joomla-16-how-tos/212-show-template-elements-on-selective-pages.html">see this article</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.xmarks.com/" title="http://www.xmarks.com/">Xmarks</a> is a great cross browser bookmark and password sync tool. I've been using it for years to sync my bookmarks between the variety of browsers that I use, which is a boon for those of us who develop for the web.</p>
<p>In January I received an email that Xmarks had decided to discontinue their service. This was also posted to the <a href="http://blog.xmarks.com/" title="http://blog.xmarks.com/">xmarks blog</a> The reason given was that charging for the service was not part of their original strategy, but their business model was not working for them, and the service was costing too much to maintain.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in steps <a href="https://lastpass.com/" title="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> an established password management tool, and save xmarks from their planned demise. They take xmarks over, and continue the service. Great. Except for one thing. Xmarks also syncs passwords, and this conflicts with LastPass. So they decide to phase out password backups from xmarks.</p>
<p>I recently lost all of my passwords and had to retrieve them from my xmarks account - something that I have had to do a few times in the past (computer fails, all info is lost, thank goodness for backups). This is where xmarks really comes into it's own, and before we had time machine, was the only way to successfully retrieve browser based settings.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, now, with LastPass, I have to manage two tools to do the job that xmarks alone did before, that's two tools for every browser I use, on each machine that I use. That's up to 26 software installations to manage. Aaaarrrrgh.</p>
<p>xmarks is a great tool, but having to run two tools to do what I used to be able to do with xmarks alone is not a preference for me. Additionally, using xmarks was very transparent and non-intrusive, whereas using last pass, is not intuitive, the popups are very annoying and the app is generally very bloated.</p>
<p>I am sure you have heard of the expression "if it's not broke - don't fix it". Well, in my opinion this applies to xmarks.</p>
<p>With the advent of Firefox sync, the only reason I am using xmarks and last pass is to sync between the many browsers that I use for web development, but in all honesty, it is easier to change my usage habits, than maintain multiple programs.</p>
<p>My opinion - they should integrate the last pass technologies into xmarks (or vice versa), but just end up with ONE app.</p>
<p>I'm grateful for being able to restore my recently lost passwords, but have now made use of Firefox sync to ensure that it does not happen again. As for cross browser bookmark backups, at last look I had several hundred bookmarks that I rarely use, most of the useful ones are already referenced in blog posts that I have written, so it's probably easier to search the blog instead.</p>
<p>But whilst I have adopted Firefox sync, I have not uninstalled xmarks or LastPass. I like others, have given them feedback on the new merger, and will wait to see what transpires.</p>

	  <p>Progress on the Boonex Dolphin to JomSocial migration script is underway, with the basic dolphin module mapped out and user data already handled by the exporter.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/dmcms/2011/04/27/end-of-the-road-for-dmcms.html">End of the road for DMCMS</a></h2>
	  <p>With it's inception way back in 2004, DMCMS was originally developed for my personal website. Written in PHP and MySQL, it was aimed at being a simple content management system with no frills that could easily handle the management of a small site. Over the years it has been modified and updated a number of times, and is still in use in a number of places.</p>
<p>With the advent of social interactivity on the web, the lack of user registration and management, and the lack of any interactivity tools have pretty much made DMCMS redundant. Whilst the management of non user based sites is still required, there are much better tools out there for the job, and with the advent of Web2 technologies, DMCMS also now looks very dated.</p>
<p>Whilst there was an update in the pipeline, with AJAX calls to streamline the admin interface, this has remained little more than half finished for the past year or so. Work on other projects has simple meant that there is no time to finish it.</p>
<p>So to make room for other stuff, and clean up the site a little, I've decided to let a few things go - one them being DMCMS.</p>
<p>Although legacy versions will not be available, and support no longer provided, you can find the demo and download links for the last release below.</p>
<p>Goodbye DMCMS.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2011/04/17/ijoomer-jomsocial-iphone-app-trumps-dolphin-oo.html">iJoomer JomSocial iPhone app trumps Dolphin oo</a></h2>
	  <p>Whilst surfing the other day I stumbled across <a href="http://www.ijoomer.com/" title="http://www.ijoomer.com/">iJoomer</a> an iPhone that connects to the joomla platform. Being a recent iPhone convert, and an avocate for Joomla / JomSocial I decided to check it out.</p>
<p>To work with your site, there is both a plugin to install and also a small code modification that needs to be made to two files. The code mod is relatively straightforward, and just involves adding a line of code to each file.&nbsp;With the plugin installed, and the mod done, you can test the application out by downloading it from the app store. Simply search for iJoomer.</p>
<p>Out of the box, the app is configured to connect to the iJoomer demo site. You can easily join the site and test out it's abilities all from the app. I initially did this, whilst checking what was happening on the site from my laptop browser before installing it on my own site. To connect to your own site simply choose settings from the log in screen and add the url of your site.</p>
<p>First impressions are that the app is very well thought out, and much more intuitive and functional than it's nearest rival, the 'oo' app offered by Boonex.&nbsp;The biggest difference between the two apps, is that the iJoomer app reports all wall activity, and with the latest JomSocial update, this even includes comments and 'likes'. It is also possible to add comments or like wall posts right from within the app itself. This is one massive failing of the Dolphin platform, decent wall functionality has to be added as a third party application, and so there is no support for it from within the iPhone app, but even so, the Boonex version does not even report the basic wall stream that is included by default, an epic fail in my opinion. Especially when you consider that it is this activity stream that has become the cornerstone for all social sites.</p>
<p>Other areas where the iJoomer app shines is the ability to upload video - something that appears to be missing in the Boonex offering, likewise there is no way to create photo galleries in the Dolphin app, a massive flaw when you want to add images whilst out and about - pretty much the main reason for having an iPhone app in the first place.</p>
<p>The one thing that the Dolphin iPhone app has in it's favour is that the main screen looks a little more polished and has a better layout, with iPhone style finger sized icons. But as usual, this is just the usual Boonex offering with something that looks very good, but lacks functionality.</p>
<p>Apart from functionality, the other main difference is price. To rebrand the iJoomer app is a one time payment of $199, whereas the oo app from Boonex requires a 'Prime' subscription of $998, and whilst this does include other aspects such as an unlimited license and one months worth of support, im my opinion is not worth the money, especially when you consider that an unlimited license is only $99.</p>
<p>My personal verdict. Yet another reason to favour Joomla / JomSocial over Boonex Dolphin.</p>

	</li>
  
	<li>
	  <h2><a href="/general/2011/03/27/dolphin-to-joomla-jomsocial-migration.html">Dolphin to Joomla (JomSocial) migration</a></h2>
	  <p>It's been a while since I've finished the Geeklog to Joomla (JomSocial) migration, and with a new update released by Boonex, I've decided that it is about time to look at migrating my sites away from the Dolphin platform.</p>
<p>With even a mildly modified site, Dolphin updates are usually a nightmare. It is rare that something does not break, or mess up in some manner, so I've decided that instead of wasting time updating third party addons to work with the new Dolphin core, it is much more cost and time effective to write a migration script.</p>
<p>The target platform will be Joomla, running the JomSocial component. This is a&nbsp;comparative&nbsp;product for those who are using Dolphin as a community site, and pretty much, all standard modules have an equivalent Joomla component.</p>
<p>At the moment the project is at the drawing board stage, but the basic outline is complete.</p>
<p>The migration script will be available as either a stand alone component that you upload to your WSP, or potentially as a Dolphin module. In either case it will be driven via a web interface, allowing you to tailor it to suit your own needs.</p>
<p>Migration will be provided for standard Dolphin modules, and also some of the major third party modules, such as the IBDW Wall module.</p>
<p>One small issue relates to password migration. As previously discussed in <a href="home/191-jomsocial-vs-dolphin.html#comment-45" title="http://www.deeemm.com/home/191-jomsocial-vs-dolphin.html#comment-45">THIS THREAD</a> the password handling in Dolphin is a little different to Joomla, and due to the encryption&nbsp;used, it is not possible to perform a direct migration of password fields. This is something that can be handled in several ways...</p>
<p>Mass password reset.<br />Forced account reactiviation<br />Modification of Joomla core to use Dolphin encryption<br />Auto password creation based on existing Dolphin data.</p>
<p>Of the above methods, the last method is something that I am currently looking into. In essence, when the user logs in, the password is checked against the values stored in the Dolphin database, if it matches, then the password is added to the Joomla database in the correct format. This process is transparent to the user, who simply uses the logon process as normal.</p>
<p>To adopt this method correctly I need to create a Joomla authentication module, so that the passwords can be verified. However, this means that the module needs to be installed for it to work, and additionally the Dolphin database needs to be available.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whatever method is used for password migration or re-creation, there will be a compromise to be made.</p>
<p>The project will be developed in stages, this is simply due to time availability. The results will then be released in one package, allowing migration to be carried out in one step.</p>

	  <p>The final part of our Geeklog to Joomla / Jomsocial migration deals with migrating the main site content.</p>
<p>With Geeklog, content is organised into 'Stories'. Similarly, with Joomla, content is organised into 'Articles'.</p>
<p>Migration is simple, and requires running one SQL command.</p>
<p>First, ensure that you copy the following tables to your new database</p>
<p><strong>gl_stories</strong></p>
<p>then simply run the following command<br /><br /><em>INSERT INTO `jos_content` (`title`,`introtext`,`fulltext`,`catid`,`created`,`hits`)<br />SELECT title,introtext,bodytext,tid,date,hits<br />FROM gl_stories<br /></em></p>
<p>You will now be able to see all of your old Geeklog stories in the Article manager.</p>

	  <p>If you are using Media Gallery to provide image handling functionality to your Geeklog site, the following will help you migrate your images. Media gallery is now an integral part of GLfusion, and so the same principles should apply to GLFusion too.</p>
<p>If you are using 4Images, it is possible to migrate to Media Gallery, using the media gallery import functions, or alternatively you may modify the code below to migrate direct.</p>
<p>The version of Media Gallery that I have migrated from is 1.5.1. and is no longer available as a stand alone plugin. However, a diligent web search will likely be able to turn up a version.<br /><br />So.... On with the migration.<br /><br />The first thing to do is to copy the following tables from your old geeklog database to your new Joomla database.</p>
<p><strong>gl_mg_media<br />gl_mg_media_albums<br />gl_mg_albums</strong></p>
<p>Once these have been copied over, you can start to migrate the data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First up we copy the image info over</p>
<p><em>INSERT INTO `jos_community_photos` (albumid, caption, published, creator, permissions, image, thumbnail, original, created, hits)<br />SELECT<br />b.album_id,<br />a.`media_title`,<br />'1',<br />c.owner_id,<br />'0',<br />concat('images/photos/',concat(a.media_user_id,concat('/',concat(b.album_id,concat('/',concat((SELECT media_filename from gl_mg_media WHERE media_id = a.media_id), concat('.', a.media_mime_ext))))))),<br />concat('images/photos/',concat(a.media_user_id,concat('/',concat(b.album_id,concat('/thumb_',concat((SELECT media_filename from gl_mg_media WHERE media_id = a.media_id), concat('.', a.media_mime_ext))))))),<br />concat('images/originalphotos/',concat(a.media_user_id,concat('/',concat(b.album_id,concat('/',(SELECT media_filename from gl_mg_media WHERE media_id = a.media_id), concat('.', a.media_mime_ext)))))),<br />a.media_upload_time,<br />a.media_views<br />FROM gl_mg_media a<br />JOIN gl_mg_media_albums b ON b.media_id = a.media_id<br />JOIN gl_mg_albums c ON c.album_id = b.album_id<br />WHERE c.album_parent='45'</em></p>
<p><br /><br />Next the album info...</p>
<p><em>insert into jos_community_photos_albums (id, photoid, creator, name, description, permissions, path, type,hits)<br />SELECT album_id, '', owner_id, album_title, album_desc, '0', concat('images/photos/',concat( owner_id, '/')), 'user', album_views from gl_mg_albums WHERE album_parent = '45'</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally, we set the album cover image</p>
<p><em>//set gallery default image (arbitrary image)<br />UPDATE jos_community_photos_albums a, jos_community_photos b<br />SET a.`photoid` = b.id<br />WHERE a.`creator` = b.`creator`<br />AND a.`photoid` ='0'</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once done all that is left is to copy the images into the correct location. This is done with the aid of a bit of PHP code. The images need to be organised into the proper folder hierarchy, which involves interrogating the database, creating the relevant folder structure, and then copying the images.<br /><br />Points to note...</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to change the database login details + database name</li>
<li>If not on the same domain, you will need to copy the existing /images/mediaobjects/orig/ contents across.</li>
<li>Correct folder permission will need to be granted to allow the script to create the folders.</li>
</ul>

	  <p>This is the second article in the migrate from Geeklog to Joomla series and outlines the method by which you can inport your existing geeklog forum into Kunena. Our previous article outlined how to migrate your users across to Joomla and also integrate them into the JomSocial component. You can find the first article here -<span> <a href="resources/tutorials/53-joomla-how-tos/201-joomla--jomsocial-import-users-from-geeklog--glfusion.html" style="color: #0062d5; text-decoration: underline;">Joomla / JomSocial - Import users from Geeklog / GLFusion</a></span></p>
<p>Kunena is a great forum component, and easily rivals dedicated forums such as phpBB or SMF. It also integrates nicely with JomSocial, allowing proper integration of avatars and profiles. Although there are other forum components available, only Kunena integration will be covered here.</p>
<p>The migration process requires that you have access to both the original site's SQL database, and the target sites database via an SQL editor. I personally favor phpMyAdmin, mostly as it comes pre bundled in C-Panel, but any other flavour will also do the job. You need to be able to export and import tables, and also execute SQL commands.</p>
<p>The basic premise is this.</p>
<p>The relevant tables will be exported from the old site and then imported into the target database. We will then execute some SQL statements to copy this data into the target database at the correct locations, and then tidy up some secondary information to make it all work. Sounds easy huh.</p>
<p>First off you will need to export the following tables from your geeklog database.</p>
<p><strong>gl_forum_topic<br />gl_forum_forums</strong></p>
<p>Next. Import these tables into your Joomla database. (You can delete them later.)</p>
<p>Once the tables have been imported you will need to run the following SQL statements, in sequence.</p>
<pre>insert into jos_kunena_messages (id, parent, thread, catid, name, userid, email, subject, time, ip, hits) SELECT id, pid, pid, 'forum', name, uid, email, subject, date, ip, views from gl_forum_topic</pre>
<p>This copies the topic titles across. it sets much of the topic information, such as which categories they belong to, but some of this needs to be 'fixed' later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>insert into jos_kunena_messages_text (mesid, message) SELECT id, comment from gl_forum_topic</pre>
<p>This statement imports the actual posts into the new database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>insert into jos_kunena_categories (id, name, parent) SELECT forum_id, forum_name, '100' from gl_forum_forums<br />insert into jos_kunena_categories (id, name, parent) values('100', 'forum category','0')<br />update jos_kunena_categories set published = '1' where published = '0'</pre>
<p>These statements set the category information, and also set each category to 'published' so that it is visible in the browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>update jos_kunena_messages set thread = id where thread = '0'<br />update jos_kunena_messages, gl_forum_topic set jos_kunena_messages.catid = gl_forum_topic.forum where jos_kunena_messages.id = gl_forum_topic.id;<br />update jos_kunena_messages set parent = thread<br />update jos_kunena_messages set parent = '0' where id = thread<br />update jos_kunena_categories set pub_access = '0' , pub_recurse = '1', admin_access = '30'</pre>
<p>Finally, these statements tidy up the messages table and correctly allocate the categories to the messages.</p>
<p>Once you have carried out the above steps you should then be able to see all of your old geeklog forum posts in Kunena.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2011/01/06/migrating-from-geeklog-to-joomla.html">Migrating from Geeklog to Joomla</a></h2>
	  <p><strong>[UPDATED!]</strong></p>
<p>Now that the New Year is under way, I've turned my focus back to the Joomla project that i have been working on. This is the migration of an existing Geeklog site over to the Joomla (JomSocial) platform.&nbsp;The basic site design and functionality has now been finalised, and the next stage is to start migrating the existing data across.</p>
<p>The migration away from Geeklog is due to the lack of development on both the Geeklog and GLFusion platforms. Although there have been releases in recent times, these have been little more than security updates. GLFusion promised to take Geeklog into the current Web 2 age, but after over a year, it has failed to really pick up any momentum, plus, with many features missing from the core and requiring non-existant third party plugins, the decision was made to migrate away from Geeklog, to the better supported Joomla.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it does not appear that many (any) have trodden this path before, and so i was not able to turn up any suitable info from the usual Google, search. This meant a bit of DIY hacking to get the data migrated. I did manage to find enough info on user authentication to be able to figure out how to migrate the users across without needing to get users to change passwords, which is a boon for a site like this one, which has some 1600 odd members.</p>
<p>I've now completed the migration process, and decided to document what I have done, to assist those who may want to do the same. I will release this in several tutorials, each dealing with a separate aspect of the migration, which is basically how I have tackled the job.</p>
<p>User migration (Geeklog to Joomla / JomSocial)</p>
<p>Forums migration (Geeklog to Kunena)</p>
<p>Gallery migration (MediaGallery to JomSocial)</p>
<p>Blog migration (GL Journal to MyBlog)</p>
<p>Stories migration (Geeklog to Joomla)</p>
<p>The Geeklog site is version 1.5.2, but I believe the process will work the same for the current 1.7 version and also the spin off GLFusion port. The Geeklog set up uses the MediaGallery plugin (MG), which is now an integrated part of GLFusion. We had previously migrated from 4Images to MediaGallery, so the same upgrade path is available for those wishing to migrate image info. Other plugins that we are running are GL Journal, a blogging plugin, and the standard GL forums, which have been migrated to Kunena.</p>
<p>First tutorial, is migration of the user data. Once performed, your users will be able to log into the Joomla / JomSocial site with their existing Geeklog credentials. You can find the article in the tutorials section or by clicking the following link</p>
<p><a href="resources/tutorials/53-joomla-how-tos/201-joomla--jomsocial-import-users-from-geeklog--glfusion.html">http://www.deeemm.com/resources/tutorials/53-joomla-how-tos/201-joomla--jomsocial-import-users-from-geeklog--glfusion.html</a></p>
<p>Second tutorial is migration of the Geeklog forums into Kunena.</p>
<p><a href="resources/tutorials/53-joomla-how-tos/203-joomla--jomsocial-import-forum-from-geeklog--glfusion-into-kunena.html">http://www.deeemm.com/resources/tutorials/53-joomla-how-tos/203-joomla--jomsocial-import-forum-from-geeklog--glfusion-into-kunena.html</a></p>
<p>Third tutorial is migration of media gallery</p>
<p><a href="resources/tutorials/53-joomla-how-tos/204-joomla--jomsocial-import-user-galleries-from-geeklog--glfusion-media-gallery-mg.html">http://www.deeemm.com/resources/tutorials/53-joomla-how-tos/204-joomla--jomsocial-import-user-galleries-from-geeklog--glfusion-media-gallery-mg.html</a></p>
<p>The final tutorial covers how to convert Geeklog stories into Joomla articles</p>

	  <p>If you wish to convert your Geeklog site to the Joomla platform, then you will have a number of things that you will need to do. First off, you will need to get a copy of Joomla up and running. In my case, I am using JomSocial, but the process is the same for both JomSocial and Joomla installations.</p>
<p>To perform this migration you will need to use a database management tool to run SQL statements. I use phpMyAdmin, which is usually bundled with most hosting packages, but you could easily use any other similar tool for this.</p>
<p>Once you have your Joomla install set up, you will need to make a backup of the following table on your Geeklog site</p>
<p><strong>gl_users</strong></p>
<p>To do this using phpMyAdmin, simply navigate to the table and then go to the export tab. Check the 'save to file' checkbox and then save the backup to your local computer.</p>
<p>Next you will need to add this table to your Joomla database. To do this using phpMyAdmin, navigate to your Joomla database and then hit the import tab. Browse to the file you just saved and then hit the 'go' button. You should now be able to see the gl_users table in your joomla database.</p>
<p>The reason for copying this is simply to make copying the fields easier. If you are only using one database with both the Geeklog and Joomla info in it, there is no need to do this</p>
<p>Now for the exciting part...</p>
<p>The main issue with user migration between platforms, is the multitude of different authentication methods used, Joomla uses a salted password, where the password is stored in the following format</p>
<p><strong>password:salt</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately for us, it still works if we leave the salt off. This is great news as it means we can simply copy our MD5 hashed Geeklog passwords straight across without having to do anything to them.</p>
<p>All that it left to do now, is to map the Geeklog database fields to their corresponding Joomla database fields, and construct an SQL statement to perform the migration.</p>
<p>The Joomla database table that contains the user data is</p>
<p><strong>jos_users</strong></p>
<p>But there are two other tables that we need to consider. These contain the user permissions data, and without corresponding entries, users will not be able to log in. These table are</p>
<p><strong>jos_core_acl_aro</strong></p>
<p><strong>jos_core_acl_groups_aro_map</strong></p>
<p>Important things to remember are that we need to maintain the same ID field as the Geeklog table, the user ID is used to reference all content, in the geeklog <em>gl_users</em> table this is the <em>`uid</em>` field. Same with the username and password fields. It is really only these three fields that are needed to get everything up and running.</p>
<p>So, putting all of this together, we end up with the following SQL statements.</p>
<p>To migrate the user data, first you will need to empty the existing data from the tables, to do this in phpMyAdmin, simply navigate to the table and then selet the 'Emtpy' tab. Just in case something goes wrong, make sure you take a backup of everything BEFORE you try any of this, then you can proceed with the migration.</p>
<p>To populate<em> jos_users</em> table</p>
<p class="code">insert into jos_users (id, username, name, password, usertype, gid, email, registerDate) SELECT uid, username, fullname, passwd, 'Registered', '18', email, regdate from gl_users</p>
<p>To populate <em>jos_core_acl_aro</em> table</p>
<p class="code">insert into&nbsp; jos_core_acl_aro (section_value, value, name) select 'users', id, name from jos_users;</p>
<p>To populate <em>jos_core_acl_groups_aro_map</em></p>
<p class="code">insert into jos_core_acl_groups_aro_map (group_id, aro_id) select '18', id from jos_core_acl_aro;</p>
<p>This will set all users as normal registered users. Assuming that you're site is like mine, and that you only have one or two admins, it's easy enough to manually change users into administrators.&nbsp;To do this you will need to change both the <em>jos_users</em> table and the <em>jos_core_acl_groups_aro_map</em> table.</p>
<p>In <em>`jos_users`</em>, change the <em>`user_type`</em> field to 'Super Administrator', and the <em>`gid`</em> field to '25'</p>
<p>In `<em>jos_core_acl_groups_aro_map`, </em>change the <em>`group_id</em>` field to '25'</p>
<p>You should now be able to log into your site using your Geeklog log in details, and also log in to the administration panel using your administrators log in details.</p>
<p>If you are a JomSocial user and you would also like to copy across your user avatars, you can use the following SQL statements</p>
<p>To copy the user avatar image info...</p>
<p class="code">INSERT into jos_community_users (userid, avatar, thumb) SELECT uid, photo, photo FROM gl_users</p>
<p>To convert the image data to include the correct path (for only those users who have an avatar)...</p>
<p class="code">UPDATE jos_community_users set avatar = CONCAT('images/avatar/', thumb) WHERE thumb not like null</p>
<p>Now, simply copy the avatars into your images/avatar folder.</p>

	  <p>This is one of those issues that has annoyed the heck out of most Dolphin users, and one that has been put in the 'too hard basket' by the dolphin devs.</p>
<p>The 'fix', however, is pretty easy.</p>
<p>Just a bit of background info - one of the reasons given for not fixing the issue is that it is too hard to determine which photos should be displayed and which should not. well I would like to call big fat bullshit on that one - if you can determine that you have to display a bug blue padlock, you can certainly determine that it does not have to be displayed at all.</p>
<p>The following fix is simply a hack - all we do is hide the div that contains the nasty blue padlock. This means that the code still gets processed as before - there are no extra overheads, it will not adversely affect your site. And, although this is not the most elegant way of&nbsp;achieving&nbsp;this, the actual solution still involves more or less the same amount of processing. To note - a better way might be to add an admin setting to allow users to select to display it / hide it.</p>

	  <p>A short time ago I upgraded the drive in my macbook pro as I had filled up the stock 250GB drive that came with it. After a little research I opted for the WD scorpio blue WD10TPVT 1 TB, as I had found out that even with it's increased height, it would still fit the macbook. But, after only a few months of use the drive has failed.</p>
<p>Fortunately the inbuilt S.M.A.R.T. check threw up an error message informing me of the impending doom, and advised me to back up my data pronto. As I could not get to a store until the weekend, I carried on using the drive for the rest of the week with no issues except running a tad slow.</p>
<p>One interesting thing that I noticed, is that, even though using OSX's 'Disk Utility', showed a S.M.A.R.T. failure (S.M.A.R.T. is a hardware check carried out by onboard diagnostics within the drive unit), Tech Tool's S.M.A.R.T. test passed as okay.</p>
<p>So, I went out at the weekend to buy a replacement drive, and to post the failed unit off for&nbsp;warrantee&nbsp;repair, as it is covered for 3 years. Unfortunately the store did not have a 1TB unit, so I purchased a WD 500GB black unit instead.&nbsp;Interestingly the store owner commented that they had stopped stocking the larger drive due to the high failure rate.&nbsp;It seems that this is one of those cases where bigger is most&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;not better.</p>
<p>My guess is that the larger drive is more fragile than its smaller counterparts and had failed as a result. I travel quite a lot, and so I quite often pack up my macbook whilst it is in standby / sleep mode, normally this is no issue, but I think in this case, with the more fragile drive, it simply did not fare too well.</p>
<p>So if you're thinking of upgrading to a 1TB drive, consider how your laptop will be treated, as it might mean your drive fails sooner than expected.</p>

	  <p>If you suffer from a non-working iTunes genius, you may find that the following fix is of some help. I recently changed my mac, and restored everything from my time machine backup, but after synching my ipod, I noticed that there were no genius mixes on the device. A bit of further digging and I found that no matter what I did I could not get genius to work in Itunes.</p>
<p>Selecting 'Start Genius' whilst clicking on a track simply returned a message telling me that genius was not available for the particular track, and that I should update genius or select another track. Unfortunately, neither worked.</p>
<p>A trawl through the web returned a couple of things to try, such as closing itunes and deleting all genius related files in the library/itunes/ folder, making sure all songs were checked, even, trying genius in different view layouts. Unfortunately none worked.</p>
<p>Eventually, I managed to track the issue down to something very simple, and also unrelated to my recent update. It turns out that a recent import of songs created with a different program, had some illegal (non alpha-numeric) characters in the ID3 tags. I changed these characters to something readable, and magically the genius then started to work.</p>
<p>it appears that non alpha-numeric characters cannot be processed by the iTunes store, my guess is that they make the track info unreadable, so genius cannot determine what songs you have.</p>
<p>A simple fix to a frustrating problem, I hope this helps someone else out.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2010/10/12/diy-maps.html">DIY Maps</a></h2>
	  <p>With the advent of Google maps, it's now very easy to add a map to your website, a few lines of code, and you have added a nicely styled map. The style is of course pretty much fixed, and you have to retain the Google logo, but it's free and easy to use.&nbsp;But what if the style does not fit in with your website, or what if you want to show some geographical data, like highlighting a specific area or region?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/stories/576903-1013201010740am.png" border="0" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently faced this same dilema, with a website that I'm working on. The google option is nice and easy to deploy, but it simply did not look right. I'm all for free enterprise, but the Google branding stuck right there on the map just detracted from the rest of the site, and for me ruined the nice clean appearance. Initially I simply wanted a clickable map of the world that I could use to link to other pages. My initial thoughts were to create an image map, but after doing a&nbsp;bit of a Google, I come up with the following website - <a href="http://backspace.com/mapapp/">http://backspace.com/mapapp/</a></p>
<p>DIY Map, is a configurable, flash based map app that allows you to embed a map with custom colours and points in your website. This can easily cope with the use that I originally intended, but I quickly realised that it could do much more. Regions can be custom configured, and individually coloured, plus points can be aded with custom hover text and icons. I decided to take advantage of the extra features, as I had a lot of point data that could be displayed.</p>
<p>The colour, region and point data is controlled from external XML files, which made it suitable for using on the website that I'm working on.&nbsp;I wrote some code to create the XML files on the fly, populating the file with data retrieved from the websites database, in this case it is simply point data, to display a clickable pin, which leads to a dedicated page displaying further info. The pin location is determined by Geo-Locations (Global co-ordinates), which allows the use of a location to geo-location converter to be employed. For this I used Google, which have a geocode lookup service. You can test this out by clicking the following link - <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/geo?q=london">http://maps.google.com/maps/geo?q=london</a> Simply replace london with any address and location.</p>
<p>I exploded the result into it's constituent elements to extract the latitude and longitude information, and then used this to populate the pin locations.</p>
<p>Geographical areas can also be highlighted by grouping countries together and applying different colours to them. This is great for creating 'heat maps' where regional areas can be coloured to indicate various statistical data. I used this to simply subdivide global areas into regions, to make them easier to see, which then allowed me to display statistical info for the region in the hover text.</p>
<p>I found the DIY Map very easy to set up and use, and also very flexible. It was easily adapted to fit in with the website I was developing, and produced a much cleaner looking interface.</p>
<p>If you are looking for an alternative to Google Maps, and want to be just a little different, or you have geographical statistics to display, then DIY Map is probably what you are looking for. Easy to use, free, and fully configurable. Maps are available for many different countries, and a variety of examples are available on the <a href="http://backspace.com/mapapp/">DIY Map home page</a></p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2010/08/16/jomsocial-vs-dolphin.html">JomSocial v's Dolphin</a></h2>
	  <p>A current project that I am looking in to is an update for an existing community site that I run. The site is based on the Geeklog platform and is a typical community site with forums, photo galleries, blogs etc. The problem that I have found with Geeklog, is that the plugins are not really actively maintained. Geeklog used to have a very active community, but a period of stagnation saw many of the contributors leave for other platforms.</p>
<p>I have updated the site a few times in the past, and each time I have ended up having to re-write the integration scripts for things such as the gallery, to be able to update them to the latest versions.</p>
<p>So a recent discussion with the other guys involved in the site has spurned me to take a look into alternatives.</p>
<p>Joomla has always been a candidate for migration, it's perfectly suited to running a site migrated from Geeklog, and has enough pugins already available to the community to be able to replicate our existing featureset. The only real problem, is that there are no migration tools, so this will have to be a custom migration job. Not really an issue, just a little more work.</p>
<p>So with the migration to Joomla, I have also been taking a more in depth look at JomSocial, the social networking plugin for Joomla.</p>
<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<p>JomSocial is pretty easy to install. You basically need to have an already set up Joomla, and then JomSocial is installed the same way that you would install a normal Joomla module or plugin - via the admin panel. There are some compatibility checks and then the plugin automatically installs. It is exactly how you would expect an installer to work.</p>
<p>With the installation finished - you are basically up and running - there is no more to do other than add in some additional plugins or applications for your members.</p>
<p><strong>JomSocial vs Boonex Dolphin - Out of the box</strong></p>
<p>For me, the obvious comparisons have to be made. I am both a Joomla user and also a Dolphin user, I have live sites running on each platform, so to compare the two products is naturally an automatic thing.</p>
<p>First off the installation for Joomla / JomSocial is a two fold process, the core Joomla installation has to be up and running before JomSocial can be installed, so there is an extra process to take care of here, but the installation process is actually very very simple - there are no directory permissions to play about with, or cron jobs to set up. and no additional modules to set up afterwards. The installation is pretty much automatic.</p>
<p>Feature-wise, JomSocial has instant appeal. It has a well functioning 'wall' - something that the Boonex product lacks, photo and video support is integrated into the base version as 'applications' available to users, as are events and groups. Not only this - but it works out of the box without any issues.</p>
<p>To add additional functionality JomSocial requires additional modules the same as Dolphin does for all it's additional functionality, but this is where JomSocial starts to shine. Not only does JomSocial have it's own dedicated extensions, but it can also use existing Joomla plugins and modules, meaning that there is already a massive resource pool for extending the functionality of the product. Whats better is that most of the extensions available to Joomla / JomSocial are free.</p>
<p>The available Joomla and JomSocial extension library takes the Joomla / JomSocial platform way past Dolphin in terms of extendability, and whats more, being a stable and well supported product, many of these extensions have been proven and tested over a much longer period than the relatively younger (and arguably - still in beta stage) Dolphin product.</p>
<p>Stability is a massive issue for Dolphin, with many bug fixes causing other issues with subsequent releases, and as Dolphin has never reached a stable release, looks like it will always be an issue.</p>
<p>Joomla on the other hand, originally based on legacy code from it's Mambo days, has continued to enjoy a stable and well supported platform. The support community are exactly as you would expect from an open source product.</p>
<p><strong>No Ajax Masturbation</strong></p>
<p>The overall layout and appearance of the JomSocial package is excellent, and includes a 'fakebook' template, which &nbsp;will please many looking to emulate the popular website. The&nbsp;implementation&nbsp;of Ajax has been carried out in a very sympathetic nature, and has only been used to enhance the user experience, rather than beat the user into frustration by it's overuse, as appears to be the case with Dolphin. This is summed up perfectly in a quote from someone over at the Unity forums, where Dolphin was described as &nbsp;'Ajax masturbation'.</p>
<p><strong>No Smoke and mirrors</strong></p>
<p>Boonex is also very good at selling Dolphin. It has various videos made about it, support is a purchased commodity, extending it's functionality will generally involve a financial investment, the whole package seems to be one that it professional and well put together, but underneath all of this is a product that still has a massive bug list, and is actually very poorly supported.</p>
<p>JomSocial on the other hand, is not promotod quite as fanatically, it's generally left to promote itself, which it does very well. This can be seen in the awards that it has won, and also in the clientele that it attracts. The support is excellent and there is none of the ego present within the Dolphin support community.</p>
<p>The coding standards followed and the coding structure adopted is much better presented within Joomla than within Dolphin, making it much easier to support and modify than it's counterpart. There is no code spaghetti and learning to maintain and modify your site is a much easier and less daunting experience.</p>
<p><strong>Just a nice stable extensible product</strong></p>
<p>In summary, I think that JomSocial is easily a match for Dolphin, and from a coders perspective is much better product.</p>
<p>It is better supported, and has many more extensions, most of which are freely available, &nbsp;not only this, but perhaps the most important factor is that it is a stable platform that also supports legacy versions - something that Boonex have never achieved with Dolphin.</p>
<p>Joomla / JomSocial also have a massive developer network, whereas Boonex only have three or four active developers - who share their time between coding for Dolphin and writing premium extensions to sell for the Dolphin platform. In this respect, the Joomla / JomSocial platform has much better vendor support.</p>
<p>The community support is also much better, for both Joomla and JomSocial.</p>
<p>At the end of the day the choice is yours. I have used Dolphin for two community sites now, and whilst it can be made to be a capable product, this is not without a lot of work. JomSocial / Joomla is pretty good out of the box, and is a much better supported product, with a wider variety of extensions. My investigation into using JomSocial for the site update I mentioned at the beginning of the post has been a very positive one, and one that will likely result in my adoption of it for the update.</p>
<p>Of course - YMMV</p>

	  <p>Boonex regulars will know that there is soon to be a new policy put in place in Unity, instant bans for anything spoken out of line. There will be no opinions about Dolphin allowed, unless they are positive, and no critiques.</p>
<p>Of course, this will probably mean that i will not last too long, I am, of course, very outspoken when it comes to Dolphin and their developers, and it is only my good nature that prevents me from saying more.</p>
<p>So in response to a forum post, that I am sure will get deleted, and more than likely get me banned, i posted the following.</p>
<pre><em>It will never change, you can disappear for 2 years and then come back here and things will be exactly like they were when you left. (except that the version number will be different) . </em><br /><em>On returning, at first things may appear to be different, as they will be dressed up in a different way, but the same issues will persist, the same complaints will be made about how the issues are handled, the same regulars will be in the forums complaining about how crap the support is, the same webmasters will be holding out, waiting for the magic version that will allow them to take their sites live, and the same core developers will be selling mods that should be core features.</em><br /><br /><em>As I know that this will be deleted - I've also posted this on my site - to prove a point. Come back and check in 2 years - It will be the same - I will stake money on it.</em></pre>
<p>To put it in context, it's a thread complaining about Dolphin, how buggy it is, and how Boonex handle management of it. My response is just some thoughts about how it always seems to be the same.</p>
<p>I originally looked at Dolphin a number of years ago and was turned off by the community reports about how many bugs it had, I returned to it about 2 years back, where I decided that it was stable enough to use for a project. Over this time, I have come to learn that not much has changed since my initial investigation all those years ago, and I am prepared to lay money that it will be the same in two years time.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2010/07/26/time-out.html">Time Out</a></h2>
	  <p>After 6 months of Dolphin development, I have decided that it is log overdue, to take some time out. The change in bias for the site from personal tech Blog to business site, alongside the change in business direction has proven to be a lot less&nbsp;profitable&nbsp;than anticipated.</p>
<p>The focus on Dolphin as a platform for which to develop was seen as a potential with high returns, and so some effort was spent in writing up some simple mods and providing support and development work for it's users. The idea was to test the water and see how the market lay.&nbsp;The reality is that the active userbase is relatively small, as are the returns.</p>
<p>The effort taken to write up even relatively simple mods, is a fairly big undertaking. Testing is required to ensure that mods function correctly, database scripts need to be written to add in additional database fields, and with every update, each mod needs to be tested and updated again. All of this amounted in an inordinate amount of time being required for developing, and maintaining a suite of mods.</p>
<p>The reality is that even with a selection of mods available, there is simply not enough of a turnover to be able to earn a living from, plus there seems to be a massive underground movement in ripping off mods - more so than with any other community that I have been involved with. People rip off your work, and pass it out like it is their right to do so. For someone trying to make a living this sucks.</p>
<p>This has left me with no option than to abandon the idea of pursuing this full time, and go back to concentrating on other works. This is why you will now see all of my old premium mods available for free, and all new mods are now being released as tutorials, which are much easier to update and maintain.</p>
<p>I currently have a few projects in the pipeline, some are web based, but most are not, and none are Dolphin related. It is these that I now want to concentrate on as they are viable projects that can potentially bring in a decent revenue.</p>
<p>I will of course keep an eye on what's happening over at Boonex, if only to keep certain people on their toes - After all, someone has to help the n00bs out.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/latest%20news/2010/07/21/dolphin-703-on-the-horizon-more-free-mods.html">Dolphin 7.0.3 on the horizon | More free MODs</a></h2>
	  <p>A new <a href="http://www.boonex.com/unity/blog/entry/A_few_updates_" target="_blank" title="http://www.boonex.com/unity/blog/entry/A_few_updates_">blog post</a> by Andrew Boon over at Boonex, has finally announced the upcoming release of 7.0.3. Whilst there is still no commitment to a date, it is scheduled for the beginning of August. This is great news, as for a moment it almost looked like Boonex had forgotten about Dolphin, I was almost certain that the next announcement from them was going to be the release of Trident.</p>
<p>It's good to see Boonex continuing to follow their promise of more regular updates, and whilst I may be very vocal over at Boonex.com about a monthly release cycle, the truth is, anything is better then the year waited for D7, especially when you consider the failure that it was bug wise. As with any of these interim releases, bugs have to be prioritised, so not everyone will get what they want, but give it time and all bugs will eventually get fixed.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what kind of balance between bugs and features there are. I personally think that the bugs should have a higher priority than features, but I guess that Boonex policy differs form this, as there are generally some new features released with every update.</p>
<p><strong>New Improved Orca</strong></p>
<p>Of interest to me is the promised updated Orca, I'm keen to find out what updates have been made to the code. The Blog announcement states...</p>
<p class="code"><em>...in 7.0.3 you're going to see a seriously improved Forum. We removed unnessesary AJAX effects, streamlined the UI, added moderation features and some basic forum features.</em></p>
<p>Hopefully the code should have now been updated to follow the new module format, as it's the only module that currently does not integrate into the core correctly (it is more of a tacked on bit of code than a true module).</p>
<p>At present my own Orca project (codenamed FRED) is on hold until the updated version is released. if there are still features missing, i will integrate the current mods into the new Orca core and continue with development.</p>
<p><strong>More Free MODs</strong></p>
<p>On a different note, I have decided to release the remainder of my premium mods for free. This means that the TinyMCE Browser mod is now available for download, for both D6 and D7 versions. If you have yet to try this, it's a very worthwhile MOD as it allows users to directly upload images and files for use within blog and forum posts.</p>
<p>With the release of my other mods a short time ago, there are now quite a few useful MODs to augment your Dolphin install. I will continue to release other modifications as I write them, generally I now release them as tutorials, as packaging them up as full mods takes up too much time.</p>
<p><strong>In the pipeline...</strong></p>
<p>Many of you will know that the MODs I write are generally developed for use on my own sites and then released for the benefit of all. As I still have a few things that I want to develop for my own sites, such as SEO optimisation and a mail handler to allow users accounts to send and receive eternal emails (I already have a basic test version of this running), there are still a few things in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The SEO MOD will take the form of an additional special 'invisible' block that can be added to any page via the page builder. This will allow extra meta data to be added to any page. Hopefully the use of this coupled with my sitemap block will help improve SEO rankings.</p>
<p>The Mail handler MOD allows users to utilise a username@mail.yoursite.com type email adress, by redirecting a catchall for subdomain emails to a script. This script then decodes the received emails and delivers them to the users inbox. At the moment this is very much an experimental feature that i am still evaluating. I have the code set up on one of my test sites, which works perfectly. My plans are to expand this to allow users to post photos and videos, directly to their account via email.</p>
<p>At this stage I am not sure whether to allow the posting of messages to external email addresses. This is a great feature if not abused, but the possibility that users can use the feature for purposes such as spam, and other less than welcome uses is something that I need to weigh up. I will keep you posted of the progress.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2010/07/02/syntax-highlighting-your-code-in-tinymce.html">Syntax highlighting code in TinyMCE</a></h2>
	  <p>After a recent tutorial a member mailed me to let me know that the code snippets were not displaying correctly. A quick look told me that this was due to my use of the <em>pre</em> tag, which prevented the text from breaking when it reached the bounds of it's containing element.</p>
<p>The fix was relatively easy - add the following hacks to force the text to wrap for <em>pre</em> formatted text...</p>
<pre>word-wrap: break-word; /* Internet Explorer 5.5+ */<span style="white-space: pre;"> <br /></span>white-space: -o-pre-wrap; /* Opera 7 */<span style="white-space: pre;"> <br /></span>white-space: -pre-wrap; /* Opera 4-6 */<span style="white-space: pre;"> <br /></span>white-space: -moz-pre-wrap !important; /* Mozilla, since 1999 */<span style="white-space: pre;"> <br /></span>white-space: pre-wrap; /* css-3 */</pre>
<p>But this got me thinking, and jarred my memory to something I was working on a little while back.</p>
<p>I had previously taken a look at syntax highlighting for WYSIWYG editors, this was for use in the DMCMS project where i wanted to allow full editing of template files from within the Admin panel. This is something that I had&nbsp;implemented&nbsp;on an earlier development version but had then abandoned. (For some reason that i can no longer&nbsp;remember)</p>
<p>The solution that I have settled on for use on DMCMS is <a href="http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror/" title="http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror/">CodeMirror</a> This acts in much the same way that TinyMCE does - it replaces the textfield with a basic code editor. The editor itself does not have any controls, and offers only basic functionality to assist you in editing files, but it is very light weight and provides code highlighting, which makes ediitng the template files a much more pleasurable experience.</p>
<p>I also looked at other solutions, probably the best of which was <a href="http://www.cdolivet.com/index.php?page=editArea" title="http://www.cdolivet.com/index.php?page=editArea">EditArea</a> The main advantage of this editor is that it is a multi document editor, and also includes it's own built in search function, but this was overkill for the use I have.</p>
<p>As posting formatted code here on this site for the tutorials does not need the editor functionality offered by these solutions, i decided to look a bit further. What i came up with was <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter" title="http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter">Syntaxhighlighter</a> This is a javascript library that can be applied to any page and will replace text within <em>script</em> or <em>pre </em>tags with a syntax highlighted version. There is also a handy <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/nawaf/archive/2008/04/10/syntaxhighlighter-plug-in-for-tinymce-3-x-wysiwyg-editor.aspx" title="http://weblogs.asp.net/nawaf/archive/2008/04/10/syntaxhighlighter-plug-in-for-tinymce-3-x-wysiwyg-editor.aspx">plugin for TinyMCE</a> which provides a nice popup window for inserting code into the editor in the correct format for Syntaxhighlighter. I've been testing this out on a dev copy of DMCMS and it works great.</p>
<p>When I get a spare half hour or so (not very often) I will update the site to use this as it makes for much easier code reading, which has got to be a bonus for a site that posts lots of code snippets like this one.</p>

<p>_bx_groups_err_country -&gt; 'please specify country'</p>
<p>The same principle applies to any predefined lists, but an additional modification will need to be made to BxEventSearchResults.php to process the new search field.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/dolphin%207.0.x%20modifications/2010/06/24/dolphin-remove-big-join-button.html">Dolphin - Remove big join button from promo</a></h2>
	  <p>There are a few different ways of removing the join button from the promo banner. The method you use will vary depending on your requirements. You can even change the location that it navigates to.</p>
<p>Here's a few different methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Remove (hide) button via CSS</strong></p>
<p>Edit the following file</p>
<p><em>templates/tmpl_uni/css/top_menu.css</em></p>
<p>Add the following to the bottom of the file</p>
<p class="code">.sys_tm_actions div.button_wrapper .bigJoinButton {<br /> display:none !important;<br />}<br /><br />.sys_tm_actions div.button_wrapper .bigJoinButton + .button_wrapper_close{<br /> display:none !important;<br />}</p>
<p>This hides the button, but relies on some CSS3 attributes (the plus sign is a boolean operator used to say that both&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Courier News', monospace; line-height: 15px;">.</span>bigJoinButton + .button_wrapper_close are required) - this is not supported by earlier versions of explorer.</p>
<p>The requirement for the second css statement is to hide the image that forms the right hand side of the button - the Boonex code does not differentiate between the login and join buttons, so without the conditional statement it will hide this image on both buttons.</p>
<p>If your template does not include this, then simply use the first statement to hide the button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Remove button via base template</strong></p>
<p>To remove the code that generates the button, edit the following file</p>
<p><em>/templates/base/login_join.html</em></p>
<p>find the following...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="button_wrapper" style="margin-right: 14px;"><input class="form_input_submit bigJoinButton submit" type="button" name="join" value="value" />
<div class="button_wrapper_close">&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<p>delete it or comment it out like this...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 15px; border-left-width: 5px; border-right-width: 1px; border-top-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #f6f6f6; font: normal normal normal 1em/1.5 'Courier News', monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border-color: #999999; border-style: solid;">&nbsp;</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Change the target of the button</strong></p>
<p>The last option is to leave the button as it is, and simply change it to open a different target.</p>
<p>Edit</p>
<p><em>/templates/base/login_join.html</em></p>
<p>find the following...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 15px; border-left-width: 5px; border-right-width: 1px; border-top-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #f6f6f6; font: normal normal normal 1em/1.5 'Courier News', monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border-color: #999999; border-style: solid;"><input class="form_input_submit bigJoinButton submit" type="button" name="join" value="value" /></pre>
<p>Change it to the following</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre style="color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 15px; border-left-width: 5px; border-right-width: 1px; border-top-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #f6f6f6; font: normal normal normal 1em/1.5 'Courier News', monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border-color: #999999; border-style: solid;"><input class="form_input_submit bigJoinButton submit" type="button" name="join" value="value" /></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of these cases, dont forget, that the button is not the only link that directs to the join.page. If your goal is to provide a custom join page, you may also have to edit other areas of the site.</p>
<p>The easy one to fix is the link that the promo banner navigates to - this can be changed via the admin panel. Harder are the links in the breadcrumbs bar and the login popup. But that's something for another article.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2010/06/21/boonex-blogs-gone.html">Boonex Blogs Gone</a></h2>
	  <p>Well, maybe the title is not strictly true, but for all intents and purposes, the user blogs over at Boonex Unity are now dead. Andrew Boon, in his infinite wisdom, has decided to remove the user blogs from displaying in the blog index, leaving this solely for Boonex team posts. Whilst there is (some) merit in this, from a commercial perspective, it leaves the user blogs with no index, and no way of knowing if there is a new post.</p>
<p>So whilst the blogs still exist, you now have to navigate to each blog individually, via each members user profile to view them. Needless to say, I cannot imagine anyone bothering to post any more.</p>
<p>It's ironic that the focus on the community at Boonex has always centered around&nbsp;their&nbsp;core philosophy of 'Unity', it seems that this is far from uniting people, in fact I woud go as far as to say that it has the opposite effect.</p>
<p>If I were to be&nbsp;blatantly&nbsp;honest, I think that it is Andrews way of dealing with opinions that do not agree with his. I am probably one of the&nbsp;contributing&nbsp;factors in this respect, as i have often made very pointed statements in the Blogs, but if you do not want people to have opinions, why have blogs in the first place? I guess that is what has now happened.</p>
<p>I think it's a bit of a cop out, after all, there have been many valid points raised in the blogs, many of these points have then gone on to be adopted by Boonex, or integrated into the code. The points that do not fit in, are easily ignored, or moderated. It seems that instead of driving opinions to be&nbsp;positive, by fixing the issues raised, the easy way out is simply to get rid of them.</p>
<p>The effect is that there will be less negativity, but in reality, it is still present, it's simply hidden from public view.</p>
<p>Overall, I think that it's a move in the wrong direction, and it would not surprise me if this was a precursor to some other event on the horizon, perhaps an event that Andrew knows will generate a lot of bad press for him.</p>
<p>I guess time will tell.</p>

	  <p>If you are experiencing memory issues with scripts, it may be necessary to increase the memory available to the script.</p>
<p>If you have access to your servers php.ini file, this is relatively straightforward -&nbsp; simply increase the value of the memory_limit directive to 128M then restart apache. However, I'm guessing that if you're reading this post, looking for a solution to memory issues, then the last sentence probably made little sense, and chances are that you do not have access to your servers php.ini file - this is true for most shared servers.</p>
<p>If you do not have access, all is not lost - you can override the value in either a custom php.ini file, or via the htaccess file - the method needed depends on the following:</p>
<p>If PHP is compiled to run as a cgi script then you will need to use a custom php.ini, but if it is compiled to run as a module then you will need to use htaccess. (tip - you can view your servers php_info() to find out which one)</p>
<p>To set via php.ini&nbsp; file use the following syntax - add this to a file named php.ini and put it in your webroot</p>
<p><em><strong><code>memory_limit = 128M</code></strong></em></p>
<p>To set via htaccess - add this to your htaccess file</p>
<p><em><strong><code>php_value memory_limit 128M</code></strong></em><strong></strong></p>
<p>If you wish to set these values within your script - you can also use the ini set method from within php</p>
<p><strong><em><code><span class="html"><span class="default">ini_set</span><span class="keyword">(</span><span class="string">'</span></span></code></em><em><code>memory_limit</code><code><span class="html"><span class="string">'</span><span class="keyword">, </span><span class="string">'On'</span><span class="keyword">);</span></span></code></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span class="html"><span class="keyword"><br /></span></span></em></strong></p>
<p>You can also use the same methods to set other php.ini directives. However, not all directives are available for modification in this manner.</p>
<p>For more info on available directives, see - <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php" title="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php</a></p>

	  <p>The Boonex team have just released the not so long awaited 7.0.2 release. It seems that they have taken community comments about a shorter release cycle on board and trimmed down the releases to enable them to be released one a month. Got to admit, i was a little skeptical that they would pull it off, but its nice to be proven wrong. Lets hope that this is the shape of things to come.</p>
<p>The 7.0.2 release addresses a number of bugs and enhancements. It also removes the callbacks to the Boonex site to prevent the issues seen during the recent DDOS attacks, where many users were locked out of their admin panels.Probably the most important bug fixed is the bug that prevented profile fields from being updated, happily, this is now fixed.</p>
<p>i have already jumped in and upgraded my D7 site, and so far there are no issues.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/dolphin%207.0.x%20modifications/2010/06/10/tag-converter.html">Dolphin Tag Converter</a></h2>
	  <p>If like me, you used the migration tool to transfer your Dolphin 6 based site over to Dolphin 7, you will notice that there are some things that need a little tweaking. One of these things for me was the tags.</p>
<p>On D6 tags could use a space as a delimiter, but on Dolphin 7 the space is ignored, this is to allow multi word tags. What this effectively does is create massive long 'tag words' out of those tags that were entered without using a comma as a delimiter in D6.</p>
<p>The following code reads the tags and splits them up if more than one word is detected. it then deletes the original entry and creates a new entry for each word detected using the original data. Single word tags are ignored</p>
<p>$sql_query = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM `sys_tags`");</p>
<p>while($sql_result = mysql_fetch_array($sql_query))</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>$sTag = $sql_result['Tag'];</p>
<p>$sObjID = $sql_result['ObjID'];</p>
<p>$sType = $sql_result['Type'];</p>
<p>$aTag = explode(" ", $sTag);</p>
<p>if (count($aTag) &gt; 1){</p>
<p>mysql_query("DELETE FROM `sys_tags` WHERE `Tag` = '{$sql_result['Tag']}'");</p>
<p>foreach($aTag as $sNewTag) {</p>
<p>mysql_query("INSERT INTO `sys_tags` (`Tag`, `ObjID`, `Type`, `Date`) VALUES ('$sNewTag', '$sObjID', '$sType', '{$sql_result['Date']}') ") or die(mysql_error());</p>
<p>echo 'new tag ' . $sNewTag . ' created<br />';</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>You will need to decide how you deploy the code - I downloaded the&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'Courier News', monospace; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;">sys_tags </span>table from my site and created a test database on my local test server with it, then I simply added a database connection to the above code it and ran it locally. I then uploaded the resultant table back to my sites database.</p>
<p>Please make sure you make a backup before running this script, as once the values have been modified there is no way to go back.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/latest%20news/2010/06/09/google-chrome-for-mac.html">Google Chrome for Mac</a></h2>
	  <p>If, like me, you have been using the beta version of Google chrome for mac, you will be pleased to learn that Google have now released the final version. Chrome for mac is only available for intel based macs, OSX version 10.5 or later. Being a long time Firefox user, I've been noticing a slowdown in performance lately that has been causing a little frustration, especially when it comes to developing. A pet peeve of mine is having to wait for the browser to finish loading pages - it's simply lost time that i could put to better use.</p>
<p>Chrome is without doubt much faster than Firefox, with very impressive page load times, even with slower pages. With the addition of a few of my favourite tools available (FireBug and Web Developer), Chrome is possibly looking like a replacement for my long term love affair with Firefox. The only downside is that FireBug is only available as a Lite version - which means that there are some critical features missing (javascript tools), but for general day to day use, you could substitute other dedicated tools instead.&nbsp;Of course, it's also possible that an updated version of FireBug for the Crome platform might surface in the future, but this is probably just fanciful thinking, as there are no reports of this as yet.</p>
<p>Chrome also comes with a nice bookmarks migration tool to easily import bookmarks from your other browsers, and includes up to the minute support for HTML5 and the emergent new web technologies. Bundle this with a with a nice clean interface, and you have an improved web experience.</p>
<p>So, if you've yet to try it, or haven't updated form the beta, I&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;to give it a go.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2010/06/08/boonex-dolphin-security-vulnerability.html">Boonex Dolphin Security Vulnerability</a></h2>
	  <p>It seems like this week is a bit of a strange one so far. Not only is it National Cyber Security Awareness Week here in Australia, but first the Boonex site suffered a massive DDOS attack and then my own dolphin site suffered a similar fate. I believe that the two events are probably coincidental, as the attack on my site was not particularly well formed, and was easily defeated - most likely just some kiddie with a script. I managed to get the service that the attack was coming from terminated due to a violation of the providers TOS - they're probably in big trouble with mom and dad now. The attack on the Boonex site continued over the weekend, and there are still some services out of action.</p>
<p>I believe that the main source of the attack on my site was to take advantage of the exploit recently published on Boonex's site, and reported about here on DeeEmm.com in an earlier news article - <a href="news/154-dolphin-7-security-vulnerability-exposed.html" title="http://www.deeemm.com/news/154-dolphin-7-security-vulnerability-exposed.html">http://www.deeemm.com/news/154-dolphin-7-security-vulnerability-exposed.html</a> Whilst the noise about this issue seems to have been muted a little, after the attack on my site I am pretty convinced that the solution given by Boonex is no solution at all.</p>
<p>The main crux of the problem was claimed to be the DB_FULL_VISUAL_PROCESSING or DB_FULL_DEBUG_MODE settings, which caused the debug backtrace to be echoed directly to the browser in the event of a fault. Boonex's comments were simply that these were disabled by default and so the issue was a non-issue. This glaring oversight caused an obvious embarrassment to those who made the claims that the issue was with the DB_FULL_VISUAL_PROCESSING setting, this then caused them to promptly back off a little.</p>
<p>Whilst Boonex's solution has seemingly pacified the masses, it does not address the initial issue - that the debug back-trace is getting echoed to the browser in some error situations. The fact is that the issue has been reported by many, and until now no one had been sure of a definite cause, unfortunately the DB_FULL_VISUAL_PROCESSING setting was little more than a red herring, and whilst easily dismissed by Boonex, their solution does not actually fix the issue.</p>
<p>The attack on my site was actually quite useful, as amongst other issues, it caused a permanent replication of this error, allowing me to test out a few ideas, and do a bit of investigative work. My findings are as follows.</p>
<p>Boonex employ the system function debug_backtrace() to generate their own backtrace, they then prevent their own backtrace from being echoed to the browser by the use of the DB_FULL_DEBUG_MODE setting. This however does not stop debug_backtrace() from dumping it's contents to the browser as it does this at a system level. Normally this is stopped by the server setting display_errors().</p>
<p>However - and this is the Killer - Boonex set the display_errors() directive to E_ALL in header.inc.php, basically overriding your server configuration so that it displays All Errors.</p>
<p>So, it seems that whilst there was a lot of noise, and some hasty decisions relating to DB_FULL_VISUAL_PROCESSING being the cause - there is still very much an issue that needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>Personally i have set display_errors() to zero in header.inc.php and commented out the Boonex code, and also commented out the entire code in the genMySQLErr function. I advise all to do the same.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/latest%20news/2010/06/02/dolphin-orca-update.html">Dolphin Orca Update</a></h2>
	  <p>The Dolphin forum, or Orca, as it is known, was a parallel stand alone development that was integrated as a module into the Dolphin 7 release. This module is a massive improvement over the previous integration in Dolphin 6, and has provided an easier opportunity to improve it.</p>
<p>Many Dolphin users are unhappy with the features supplied with the standard forum module, often opting to replace it with other forums such as phpBB or IPB. This has mixed success, as often the integrations are simply iframe hacks, or miss out important aspects such as avatars or messaging. This is where Orca is already a step ahead. The integration is already completed, it is a core part of the Dolphin product, and so already has all of the needed variables and data available to it, to use in improving its features.</p>
<p>We have been working on an update to Orca, to add in the missing features that many complain about, these are usability features for both users and administrators alike, as well as the creation of a set of moderation tools.</p>
<p>The project is in it's very early stages, and only in Alpha release, but as it's based on a functional product, we already have a demo set up. This will be updated as the project progresses.</p>
<p><strong>Planned Features for Version 1</strong></p>
<p>The following features are planned for the first release. This list may not be exhaustive, and could possibly change over time, but for the time being is a good indication of what we would like to achieve. The current time-frame for the version one release is not known, but we would like to aim for about a month.</p>
<ul>
<li>Administration interface to control all standard features / settings</li>
<li>Moderators</li>

	  <h2><a href="/latest%20news/2010/05/30/dolphin-7-security-vulnerability-exposed.html">Dolphin 7 Security Vulnerability Exposed</a></h2>
	  <p>It would seem that this weekend has been an active time in the CMS community for security vulnerabilities, first Joomla issue a patch for a potential XSS issue, and now Boonex's Dolphin package has been raising some eyebrows with, an as yet unresolved security issue that exposes the database name, username and password, in plain text to the browser via a verbose error report. This report is triggered by any number of bugs, and could easily be used to compromise a website or server.</p>
<p>The security 'hole' had previously been reported and raised as an issue with the Dolphin developers, who's response was that it had been addressed. Amusingly this seems not to have been the case, with the latest attention being that the bug has now been witnessed on the Boonex admin test site, and the resulting full error report published. - <a href="http://www.boonex.com/unity/forums/topic/Hey-BoonEx-Notice-Something-.htm">http://www.boonex.com/unity/forums/topic/Hey-BoonEx-Notice-Something-.htm</a> There is some further discussion in the blogs as well - <a href="http://www.boonex.com/unity/blog/entry/Major_Security_Risk_Information_and_Temporary_Solution">Major Security Risk: Information and Temporary Solution</a></p>
<p>The community were quick to act, with a couple of suggested workarounds published on modmysite - <a href="http://www.modmysite.com/general-issues-comments-questions/10491-db_full_visual_processing.html#post39764">http://www.modmysite.com/general-issues-comments-questions/10491-db_full_visual_processing.html#post39764</a> as well as on the Boonex site, but there has been no official response.<a href="http://www.modmysite.com/general-issues-comments-questions/10491-db_full_visual_processing.html#post39764"><br /></a></p>
<p>As of the time of this post, some three days after the original post, Boonex have still yet to comment, and there has been no official patch available to address the issue.</p>
<p>The security flaw raises the question of the validity of the security audits that were supposedly conducted on Dolphin 7 and 7.01 prior to release, and certainly brings into disrepute those that conducted it.</p>
<p>If you are currently running Dolphin 6 or 7 use the following instructions to address the issue (fix courtesy of Smoge at modmysite)</p>
<pre>Below are instructions including what file to check, <br />and what to change, to avoid this situation.<br />
Dolphin 7.0.x (inc/classes/BxDolDb.php)<br />Dolphin 6.0.x and 6.1.x (inc/db.inc.php)<br /><br />Look for the value, near the top of the file, like:<br /><br />define( 'DB_FULL_VISUAL_PROCESSING', true );<br /><br />It should be set to:<br />
define( 'DB_FULL_VISUAL_PROCESSING', false );<br />
Making this change will prevent users from seeing debug <br />information (some sensitive) in the event your site has <br />a database error.</pre>

	  <h2><a href="/latest%20news/2010/05/27/free-mods-released.html">Free Mods Released</a></h2>
	  <p>It's been a very busy week here in the software office. Hot on the heels of the recent <a href="store.html?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;product_id=12&amp;category_id=2" title="http://www.deeemm.com/store.html?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;product_id=12&amp;category_id=2">Flat Comments</a> and <a href="store.html?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;product_id=11&amp;category_id=3" title="http://www.deeemm.com/store.html?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;product_id=11&amp;category_id=3">Group Forum Posts Block</a> mods, we have a further three - yes that's THREE!! new mods available in the store, plus a re-released oldie.</p>
<p>Whats more, three of the mods are free!</p>
<p>The first mod is a re-release of our Login redirect mod for Dolphin 6. Whilst this has been available for download over at Boonex.com, for some reason it was omitted from the store, so we added it in. You can download it <a href="store.html?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;product_id=15&amp;category_id=2" title="http://www.deeemm.com/store.html?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;product_id=15&amp;category_id=2">HERE</a></p>
<p>Next up is Auto Friend on Join. This is another Dolphin 6 mod that has been updated to work with Dolphin 7. The Mod automatically adds a friend to the joining members profile - a bit like Tom on myspace. This mod differs a little as it will add select the friend it adds based on the gender of the joining member. It can be set&nbsp; to add either a friend of the same sex, or opposite sex. Get it <a href="store.html?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;product_id=14&amp;category_id=3" title="http://www.deeemm.com/store.html?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;product_id=14&amp;category_id=3">HERE</a></p>
<p>Whilst we was fixing the Auto Friend on Join mod up for Dolphin 7, we decided to tweak it a little so that it could be used to automatically make the new member a fan of a group. The original idea came from a Boonex Unity member who wanted this on their site, so we decided to write it up for him. Get it <a href="store.html?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage_no_button.tpl&amp;product_id=16&amp;category_id=5" title="http://www.deeemm.com/store.html?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage_no_button.tpl&amp;product_id=16&amp;category_id=5">HERE</a></p>
<p>The last mod is a premium mod. It's an updated version of the Flat comments mod recently released for Dolphin 6. The mod has been updated for the Dolphin 7 platform. The mod is exactly the same - it converts all nested comments into a flat comment structure and prevents further threaded comments from being entered. For more details, you can view it in the store by clicking <a href="store.html?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;product_id=13&amp;category_id=3" title="http://www.deeemm.com/store.html?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;product_id=13&amp;category_id=3">HERE</a></p>
<p>Hope you enjoy these three free mods, and keep a watch out for some more mods being released soon.</p>

	  <p>Just released two new mods for the Boonex Dolphin platform.</p>
<p>The first mod is a Dolphin 6 mod that changes the standard threaded comments layout to a normal flat comment structure. All existing comments are changed to the new layout, as will all new comments.</p>
<p>The second modification is a Dolphin 7 MOD that creates a custom block for the groups home / view page that aggregates the groups forum posts.&nbsp; This increases the usefulness of the groups home page by providing all information in one place.</p>
<p>As a bonus, we have also included an additional mod that will show you how to add a block anywhere on your site to aggregate ALL group forum posts into one block.</p>
<p>Both mods are available for purchase either here, via the webstore, or via the Boonex marketplace.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/php/2010/05/26/nowdoc-string-handler.html">Nowdoc string handler</a></h2>
	  <p>Some of you may be familiar with the <strong><em>heredoc</em></strong> string handler which allows multi-line strings to be easily assigned to a variable, this great tool has many uses - such as retaining pre-formatted layout and improving the readability of code. The heredoc handler also parses variables contained within the string - much the same way that using double quotes does. Replacing any variables with their respective values</p>
<p>This has some not so obvious drawbacks, one of which i discovered whilst trying to inject complex PHP code into a database for later evaluation via the eval() statement. (please don't ask why)</p>
<p>The problem I found was that whilst it was easy to escape the string so that it would not break the SQL statement, The same escape characters also broke the evaluation. This might not have been an issue in any other situation, but for this particular project i did not have access to the code that carried out the evaluation so that I could strip the escape characters out before running the eval query.</p>
<p>However, PHP 5.3 has now introduced the nowdoc syntax - this basically operates in the same manner as heredoc, but does not parse any of the content. This means that not only are variables not parsed, but neither are any characters that would normally require escaping. In essence, any string read into a variable by the nowdoc handler will not require any escaping whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>heredoc format</strong></p>
<pre>$somevar = &lt;&lt;your multi<br />line text<br />$here<br />EOF;</pre>
<p><strong>nowdoc format</strong></p>
<pre>$somevar = &lt;&lt;your multi<br />line text<br />$here<br />EOF;</pre>
<p>Th difference is only a small one - the nowdoc syntax has single quotes around the identifier.</p>
<p>A great fix for an annoying issue, but one that is unfortunately not without it's caveats, the biggest one being that PHP 5.3 is still relatively new and there is no backwards equivalent.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/javascript/2010/05/26/scroll-to-top-of-page.html">Scroll to top of page</a></h2>
	  <p>Regular hyperlinks and anchors are fine for navigating pages in most situations, but i found that whilst trying to add an anchor to the top of a dynamically created page, so that i could add a 'return to top of page' link to the bottom, there was nowhere to add the code. A different approach was required.</p>
<p>The solution I found was to use the javascript scroll command. This simply resides at the location you require the link - in my case at the bottom of the page. The code I used was as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="code"><a href="javascript:scroll(0,0)">^Top</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously you can replace the '<em><strong>^Top</strong></em>' text with whatever you require.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/latest%20news/2010/05/14/its-official-ie6-is-outdated.html">It's Official. IE6 is Outdated</a></h2>
	  <p>I have long held the view that the internet needs to be ridded of Internet explorer 6. IE 6 still equates to a massive 10% of all user-agents - some 180,233,045 users worldwide. This figure has fortunately been getting smaller, and the latest statistics show that IE6 has been in steady decline this year.</p>
<p>IE6 is the veritable thorn in the side of most web developers (with IE7 little better). With a userbase numerous enough to still require having to account for when developing websites, IE6 requires extraneous coding hacks to get it to function along side more modern browsers. But this may soon be a thing of the past. It seems that Microsoft themselves are now promoting the demise of IE6. This is great news, and one could only like to think that it is as the result of folk such as you and I actively promoting it's drawbacks. I personally think that IE6 has finally bitten Microsoft on the proverbial backside, with Internet Explorer usage failing to the ever more popular Firefox, which now reports some 45% market share.</p>
<p>The pain in the proverbials, has seemingly spurned Microsoft into action to try and win back some users, and tip the scales back in their favor - and they seem to be targeting IE6 users. So what have they done?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/screenshots/ie8.jpg" border="0" alt="ie8advert" width="281" height="258" style="border: 0; float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;" /></p>
<p>I received an email today from Microsoft&nbsp; - entitled 'You wouldn't drink 9 year old milk - So why use a 9 year old browser' - a direct hit against their own Explorer 6 product. The email has a nice picture of a milk carton with the sell by date of August 2001, an amusing image directly echoing the thoughts of many of the anit-IE6 lobby. The email then goes on to explain the virtues of IE8 whilst also offering some smeary facts against the competitors to further bolster what a great product they consider IE8 to be. Typical marketing strategy here in Australia, where advertising laws do not seem to prohibit libelous comments.</p>
<p>it's an interesting marketing concept, and reminds me a lot of those washing powder commercials back in the UK - 'new and improved Baz washing powder - now 100% better then old Baz'. I could never see how such a ploy would work - the new version of the product, claims to be better then the old version and can get whites - white - something that the old version could not do. It just seems like a lot of lying to me, surely the general public could not be that stupid?</p>
<p>But, sales figures do not lie, and apparently general consumers are actually this stupid. So I think that this is probably a ploy that may work for Microsoft - after all, these stick-in-the-mud IE6 users have withstood changing to other browser manufacturers, maybe hearing that the manufacturer that they know and trust recommends that they update may sway them.</p>
<p>Will this gain Microsoft the upper hand? I doubt it. Even if they convert all IE6 users to IE8 users they will still be woefully short of a majority market share, not by much, but by enough.</p>
<p>It seems that Open Source solutions are finally coming into their own - first stop browsers - next stop operating systems... Well, we can live in hope.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2010/05/11/dolphin-701-and-beyond.html">Dolphin 7.0.1 and beyond</a></h2>
	  <p>The latest release to Boonex's CMS system - Dolphin 7, has now been out on the wild for some time. Released at Christmas, the much anticipated Dolphin 7 was to be heralded as the latest in web tech, offering an advanced platform for social networking sites that was far ahead of the competition. With several public beta releases, the anticipation was fueled by the glimpses offered in each release, building up the expectations to a massive level. Also adding fuel to this fire, was the long overdue update and bugfix release due for Dolphin 6. As a result, Dolphin 7 had a lot to deliver.</p>
<p>With the release of Dolphin 7 finally made a year later than expected, it was unleashed into the public with a massive amount of issues, over 300 bugs to be precise. This left the Dolphin community a little abashed, with many users having stuck with Dolphin, through the extended development period, now feeling disappointed. Lots of these users had put development plans on hold, with the expectation that the promised release would be the answer to their needs.</p>
<p>It is now a further 5 months down the line, and the recent update release 7.0.1 has addressed many of the problems that plagued version 7. The problems are not completely fixed however, and there are still many issues surrounding how development and releases are handled, but it seems that Boonex are moving in the right direction with a shorter release cycle, and prioritisation of bugs addressed for each release. I previously touched on this issue with one of my blog posts over at unity - <a href="http://www.boonex.com/unity/blog/entry/Product_release_cycles">http://www.boonex.com/unity/blog/entry/Product_release_cycles</a></p>
<p>Based on past performance at Boonex, and anticipating the issues and extended wait with version 7, when it was originally announced, I decided to stick with version 6&nbsp; - This is a choice that i am glad i made. Not only as the expected release date slipped way beyond the original estimate, and there were more issues than even I anticipated, but also as it has meant that I have managed to build my user-base over the past year, and develop the community for which the site serves.</p>
<p><strong>6.1.6 to 7.0.1 Migration</strong></p>
<p>So with the 7.0.1 release, I decided that it was actually time to take the plunge and update my Dolphin 6 site. The 7.0.1 release is not without it's issues, but in comparison to a standard 6.1.6 installation, they are probably about on par. My main apprehension with the update was that i would be losing some premium modifications - purchased mods that definitely enhanced the user experience, these, plus many other minor mods and bugfixes that I had carried out myself - amounting to over 60 mods in all.</p>
<p>Ultimately, i decided that the additional features offered by the new version, and the overall improvement in the interface was worth the trade off for the few premium mods that I would lose.</p>
<p>I tested an update to the new version 7.0.1 direct from version 6.1.6 using the migration module, but found that there were a few fields not transferred - so I decided to reinstall version 7, perform the migration, and then update to the new 7.0.1 version. The migration was straightforward enough - and once you had manually fixed the update package, the update was also relatively painless.This has now given me a working 7.0.1 site, but this is not without some issues that needed to be addressed.</p>
<p>There are additional steps that you will need to do manually to completely transfer over your Dolphin 6 site to version 7. Most of these relate to missing database data - data that is present and can be converted, but for some reason is missed. I manually had to transfer the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Links are not converted to Sites</li>
<li>Photo and video view counts are not transferred</li>
<li>Tags are not transferred correctly</li>
<li>Quotes not transferred</li>
<li>FAQ / About / Privacy pages not transferred</li>
<li>Additional user created pages not transferred</li>
<li>Subscribers not transferred</li>
<li>Old mass mailer emails not transferred</li>
</ul>
<p>So far the site seems pretty stable, and with a few tweaks to the standard template does not look too different to the old site. I've already started to redo the mods that I previously had in place on the old site that have not been covered by the new version 7 features, and will be releasing these in the marketplace as I get around to documenting them.</p>
<p><strong>So what do I think?</strong></p>
<p>Well - those of you who frequent Unity, will already know my thoughts on how Boonex handle development and releases, so I will not repeat them here. My main issues with the 7.0.1 update are that whilst an issue was discovered with the upgrade package, it was not addressed, the package is still being shipped with the problem plus a convoluted set of instructions on how to circumnavigate it. To me this is not a very professional way of handling the problem, especially when you consider that some users have paid nearly $1000 for licensing.</p>
<p>For me - I take Dolphin at face value - I do not consider it a mature product, and so I expect it to have problems - an expectation which is unfortunately met tenfold. I get the feeling that Boonex is trying very hard to be a market player, by portraying a professional image, and largely acting like one, but time again it lets itself down with actions like the faulty update package - not an issue in itself - but an issue because it has not been dealt with in a professional manner. This unfortunately extends to the rest of the development too.</p>
<p>The software itself still has some way to go. It embraces a few web2 technologies such as employing the excellent jqeury framework and a generous splattering of Ajax, which whilst improving the overall user perception of the product, is in my eyes a little overused. It's almost comparable to the abuse made to the internet by the blink and marquee tags some 10 years ago - they key to implementing enhancements like these is simply to know when to stop, if it does not add value (ie Ajax exchanges that take longer then page loads, or amateurish looking sliding page masks) then it simply should not be included.</p>
<p>Overall Dolphin brings together the key elements of a good community into one product, but whilst the integration of each element has been executed quite well, each individual element on it's own is little more than average - and this is despite the attempts to dress them up with Jquery animations and the like.</p>
<p>This is also not an observation that is isolated, it is one shared by quite a few of the Unity forums regulars - users that have even undertaken integrations of third party elements to bring Dolphin up to what they consider a more usable product.</p>
<p>The perception of quality all depends of course - on what your particular community requires - for my site it suits fine, but of course your mileage may vary.</p>
<p><strong>Would I recommend this product? </strong></p>
<p>if you are webmaster with some coding skills, that doesn't mind getting their hands dirty on a regular basis - then Dolphin is great - it is a very 'hands on' package - there is generally always something to fix / improve, but for the fact that it needs work to get it 100% overall the product is a good one. In this case - yes I would recommend it - but don't expect to have a great dolphin site without quite a bit (months) of work, and a few headaches trying to figure out the 'spaghetti logic'.</p>
<p>However, If you were to ask me if i would recommend this to my clients - I would say no. Simply because it is high maintenance, and would probably require many post installation visits to address the issues that my client discovers - not a good business plan - even if I am getting paid to fix the issues.</p>
<p>I would also suggest that a stable mature Dolphin is still some way off, and so issues should still be expected for the next few releases. My guess is that it will take at least six months to a year to iron out all of the bugs, by which time the focus would likely have shifted to the already mentioned Dolphin 8 - leaving Dolphin 7 to take a seat next to Dolphin 6 - unfinished and unloved.</p>
<p><strong>So, would I change from using Dolphin for my own site?</strong></p>
<p>At this stage I would say no. I simply have too many hours invested in it, and there is no direct migration path to a comparable product. There is also the fact to consider that my site is a relatively small specialist community site, it is not high traffic, and does not earn money, so there is very little disadvantage from the occasional issues that arise. But this may be a different story for a commercial site.</p>
<p>For me - for the time being, I will stick with Dolphin, but if you are a new user considering it for the first time, my advice is simply to make sure that you approach it with your eyes wide open, if you know what to expect, you will not be disappointed.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/dolphin%207.0.x%20modifications/2010/05/02/d7-move-avatar-from-promo-to-banner.html">D7 Move avatar from promo to banner</a></h2>
	  <p>After updating my Dolphin 6 site to the new version 7 software I decided that I wanted to move the avatar to the banner - basically the same as for my D6 site. I also wanted to put the quotes at the bottom - I decided to mimick the style and layout for my D6 site - I wanted my upgrade to D7 to be more or less transparent to my users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>How To Relocate the daily quotes</strong></h3>
<p>To modify the quotes position is&nbsp; simple enough - you just need to modify the sys_injections table - look for <strong>quotes_injection</strong> and then change the key to<strong> injection_footer_after</strong></p>
<p><strong>injection_footer_after</strong> refers to the tag that the content will replace - in this case the tag in the footer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="code">bx_injection:injection_footer_after /&gt;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is only half of the story though - as the quotes do not display correctly - this is mostly as the css has a <strong>position:absolute</strong> attribute - this needs to be changed to position:relative, or removed altogether. This can easily be changed in unit.css in the quotes module - look for the <strong>.quote_div</strong> class name. Whilst you are there you might also want to change the rest of the styling to suit your own site.</p>
<p>You can also override the modules style by adding the following to general.css</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="code">div.quote_div { position:relative;}</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or just use the following code which will also position it nicely</p>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; div.quote_div {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; position:relative;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; margin-top:20px;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear:both;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; width:100%;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; div.quote_div div.daily_quotes {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; text-align: center;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could also put the quotes block anywhere you like by creating your own injection points - simply add the following tag to your template in the position you want to inject the code - I added this after the footer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="code">bx_injection:my_injection /&gt;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then change the key in the sys_injections table to <strong>my_injection</strong>. Now the quotes display below the bottom footer instead of inside it.</p>
<p>You can include any kind of custom content in this manner by adding it to the sys_injections table - include the custom php code you want to execute in the data field and make sure you change the type to php.</p>
<p>In this manner you can include the avatar and username in the banner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Add the avatar to the banner</h3>
<p>The code that puts the avatar and username in the promo block is in design.inc.php - unless you want two avatars displayed you will need to comment it out after you have moved it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>$aInfo =  getProfileInfo(); &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />$sWelcomeElement = '</pre>
<div class="label_thumbnail">' . get_member_thumbnail($aInfo['ID'], "left", false) . '</div>
<div class="label_thumb">' . _t('_Hello member', $aInfo['NickName']) . '</div>
<pre>';</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simple create a new entry into the sys_injections table - I called it 'avatar' - then add in the info. We can use the same code for generating the avatar and text for the header. You have to change the way that the code is handled slightly - but not too much - we also need to check if the user is logged in. if not we will display nothing, but we could easily show the login / join buttons instead.</p>
<pre>$aInfo = getProfileInfo(); <br />return $aInfo = getProfileInfo();  if(isMember()) { return '</pre>
<div class="label_thumbnail">' . get_member_thumbnail($aInfo['ID'], "left", false) . '</div>
<div class="label_thumb">' . _t('_Hello member', $aInfo['NickName']) . '</div>
<pre>';} <br /><br /><br /></pre>
<p>Make sure that you set the key to injection_logo_after so that it is injected in the same position as the quotes were.</p>
<p>You will now see the avatar and text displayed in the header - but you will notice that it does not display 100% correctly - it displays underneath the logo. This is because there are no style elements associated with it - the original styles applied in index.css no longer apply as the elements were explicitly defined - To remedy this simply add the following styles in general.css for the image and test respectively and style them to suit your needs</p>
<pre>div.sys_ml_wrapper div.label_thumbnail {&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />    position:relative;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;  float:right;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;  top:28px;<br />}<br /><br />div.sys_ml_wrapper div.label_thumb {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;  float:right;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;  margin-right:20px;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;  position:relative;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;  top:60px;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />}</pre>

	  <h2><a href="/dmcms/2010/04/12/dmcms-beta-builds.html">DMCMS beta builds</a></h2>
	  <p>In a recent <a href="resources/dmcms/20-new-direction.html#20" title="http://www.deeemm.com/resources/dmcms/20-new-direction.html#20">forum post </a>about DMCMS, i promised that at some point the current version would be spruced up a little and released as version 1. This is something that I actually started on late last year, but the work was lost when our house was burgled and my laptop (and also the backup drive) was stolen. This happened last September, and it's taken this long to renew the enthusiasm in DMCMS. This is probably spurned in the most part, by the new direction that the site has recently taken, with more time being spent putting web based code mods together, I've began to start thinking about getting DMCMS finished off again.</p>
<p>With more visitors coming for code tutorials and to buy modifications from the store, DMCMS is a bit of a show-case - not in the respect that it is anything worth looking at (it's 6 years old now, and very basic by today's standards) but in the respect that it may be used as some kind of yard stick for my work. So it needs to be tidied to the point where it is at least presentable.</p>
<p>My ideal goal would be to take it and completely re-write it using the jquery framework, smarty template's and maybe a few other Web 2 goodies. Probably the most important aspect would be making it a multi-user version, to allow commenting and third party participation, and using object based code to allow for extensibility.</p>
<p>So with this in mind - I've taken the first steps to getting the current version up to a version 1 release standard. The main changes that I previously carried out were mostly a simple code restructure. The administration interface was completely split away from the main code so that it functioned as a stand alone interface - and some of the other functions that were crammed into the main code were also parred away.</p>
<p>Not only this. But I've also decided to publish the releases as they happen - as 'snapshots. The idea is that I can have a little discussion in the forums about what changes I've made and hopefully invite some interest in what's going on. The new 'beta builds' are available from the downloads link in the DMCMS menu, and will be updated as they happen. As with any development project - these builds may or may not work. They are simply a snapshot of the work that is happening at the moment. That said - I will endeavor to keep a stable version available in addition to the snapshots. The first stable version is simply the unreleased 077 version that I have had kicking around since last October, and the snapshot is halfway through the administration interface split.</p>
<p>For the time being the files will simply be zipped and available as a download. A Subversion repository is planned in the coming weeks, as another change i will make with the new versions is a break away from Sourceforge for my download and CVS handling.</p>
<p>Don't forget to check the forums for build discussions.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2010/04/09/boonexnerd-update.html">BoonexNerd Update</a></h2>
	  <p>Just had a bit of a chat with James Tadeo, who has recently updated his successful Boonex support site <a href="http://www.boonexnerd.net" title="http://www.boonexnerd.net">BoonexNerd.net</a> to run from the latest Dolphin version - 7.0.0. James <a href="http://www.boonexnerd.net/dolphin-7/blogs/entry/Site-Update-to-Dolphin-7-in-Progress" title="http://www.boonexnerd.net/dolphin-7/blogs/entry/Site-Update-to-Dolphin-7-in-Progress">blogged</a> about the migration which he said went fairly smoothly using the migration tool that comes with D7, great news to hear for those of us who have still yet to update.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about the update to my own Dolphin site. I started to have a look at this a little while back - i set up a fresh D7 installation, which had a few issues as I had to reconfigure the server setup to suit D7. then I made a start with the data migration tool. I got as far as transferring the user-base over, but have been pretty busy since, and so have never progressed any further.This is something that I really need to make some time to go and sort out.</p>
<p>My main concern was that my D6 site is fairly modified, and whilst D7 does have greatly improved functionality, it does lack some of the mods that my members have come to expect. These mods are a mixture of purchased mods and mods that I have developed myself. There are also a large number of minor enhancements and bug-fixes that are hopefully now covered by the new D7 feature-set. the site has been developed over the past year, which is a nice and comfortable time frame to have developed a site this modded. Unfortunately with the upgrade, time is not that plentiful.</p>
<p>At present I think I will wait for the D 7.0.1. update to be released before revisiting the upgrade. I will have a look into rewriting the current mods for D7 and see how much work is involved, maybe I can temporarily drop a few of the mods to buy a bit of time.</p>
<p>Will keep you posted.</p>

	  <p>Whilst recently packaging some files for distribution, I noticed that that the folders that i was compressing contained .DS_Store files. These .DS_Store files are hidden files used by OSX to store metadata such as icon position and view settings. They are similar to the thumbs.db file used on windows, and are equally annoying when packaging files up for viewing on other systems.</p>
<p>By default the .DS_Store files are hidden in OSX, unfortunately this is not so for other systems where they are displayed alongside whatever content you packaged Not wanting to have to manually drill down through various folder levels to delete each and every instance, I decided to have a quick google to see what I could find.</p>
<p>First page up led me to <a href="http://software.ryangrier.com/archives/" target="_blank" title="http://software.ryangrier.com/archives/">Ryan Grier's site</a>, where he has an application called the 'DS_Store Cleaner v1.5' listed. The app has not apparently been updated since January 2005, but this is not an issue, as the app works perfectly.</p>
<p>Basically after unzipping the app, place it somewhere on your mac (the application folder seems like a good spot) and then drag it to your dock to create an icon. Now simply drag the folder you want cleaned onto the DS_Store Cleaner icon. After chugging away for a little while, you will be notified by an alret box as to how many .DS_Store files have been deleted.</p>
<p>The App is no longer maintained, but as it works fine on my copy of Leopard, this does not seem to be an issue, my only criticism is that some kind of progress indicator would be handy.</p>
<p>You can download the app from the Authors site - <a href="http://software.ryangrier.com/archives/" target="_blank" title="http://software.ryangrier.com/archives/">http://software.ryangrier.com/archives/</a></p>

	  <h2><a href="/mac%20how%20to's/2010/03/16/restore-deleted-mac-mail-inbox-from-time-machine.html">Restore deleted Mac Mail inbox from Time Machine</a></h2>
	  <p>If, like me, you have deleted your email account without first moving or saving messages from your inbox, you will soon notice that removing the account also automatically deletes all folders associated with the account. The Inbox, sentbox and any other folders you have created will have disappeared without a trace. I deleted an account as I needed to change the protocol from POP to IMAP, and this seemed the quickest way (you cannot modify the setting directly in preferences). What I didn't realize was that the mail folders would disappear too.</p>
<p>So. No problem - I can simply use my trusty Time Machine backup to restore the deleted files.</p>
<p>OK - open mail app - put focus on inbox - open time machine - browse to older backup.....</p>
<p>mnnnnn. Something wrong here.</p>
<p>I cannot browse to an older backup as i deleted it, and even creating a new version of the same account will not work, as it simply did not exist before it was created.</p>
<p>The simple solution is to choose a different mailbox (if you have multiple accounts) and browse back in time with this selected instead. Now you can go back in time - you will see your old mailbox appear. If you do not have multiple mail boxes simply select the whole inbox instead.</p>
<p>When you are at the correct date - hit restore and then exit time machine.</p>
<p>When you look in your Mail application, you will now notice that there is an new folder called 'Time Machine' in the 'On My Mac' folder. Inside this will be the mailbox(es) that you chose to restore. These will not necessarily be labeled as per the original mailbox, so if you have restored multiple mailboxes, you may need to look through them to determine which is which.</p>
<p>At this point it is worth noting that if you restored the whole inbox, you will now have a separate folder in the recovered mailboxes folder for every mailbox folder one the machine - past and present. The handling of email backups in time machine is strange in this respect.</p>
<p>Don't forget - you might also need to recover your sent emails too. The same process applies. To recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Mail app</li>
<li>Navigate to Sent Items (or folder requiring recovery)</li>
<li>Open Time Machine</li>
<li>Go back to suitable date</li>
<li>Hit the restore button</li>
<li>Close Time Machine</li>
<li>Move the restored files from 'On My Mac' &gt; 'Time Machine' &gt; 'Recovered Mailboxes' &gt; 'Somemailboxname' to their new location.</li>
<li>Delete Unneeded Folders when finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, the easiest solution I found to changing a mailboxes transport protocol settings, was to create a new account, with the correct settings and then move the emails from the old folders to the new folders before deleting the old account. Obvious really - but then hindsight is a wonderful thing.</p>

<p style="font-size: 13.5px; line-height: 21px;"><span class="code">/libraries/tcpdf/tcpdf.php</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 13.5px; line-height: 21px;">Find the following code in the footer() function</p>

	  <h2><a href="/joomla%201.5%20how%20to's/2010/03/01/tinymce-add-items-to-style-drop-down.html">TinyMCE - add items to style drop down</a></h2>
	  <p>If you have to display code snippets on your Joomla site, you might find that the following mod is of help. This quick mod will allow you to add items to the styles drop down in the TinyMCE editor - in this case a style for the code class.</p>
<p>The mod is pretty straight forward.</p>
<p>Normally when TinyMCE is called it looks for a stylesheet called 'editor.css' in the default templates CSS folder. The contents of this are used to propagate the styles drop down. If this file is not found in the default templates CSS folder, then the system version is used instead. To add custom styles to the drop down, simply create the following file. (where current_template is the name of your template)</p>
<p class="code">/templates/current_template/css/editor.css</p>
<p>Now you can add in the styles that you want displayed I added the following class to display the code as shown on this page</p>
<p class="code">pre, .code {<br /> padding: 10px 15px;<br /> margin: 5px 0 15px;<br /> border-left: 5px solid #999999;<br /> border-right: 1px solid #999999;<br /> border-top: 1px solid #999999;<br /> border-bottom: 1px solid #999999;<br /> background: #FFFFFF;<br /> font: 1em/1 "Courier News", monospace;<br /> }</p>
<p>After uploading the new editor.css file you should be able to see the option 'code' in the drop down menu. To use it, select the text in the editor you want the style applied to and then select code form the drop down menu.</p>
<p>Whilst this has altered the way that the code is displayed in the editor, we still have to alter the way that it is delivered to the browser. To do this you will need to add the same code above to your templates default style sheet</p>
<p class="code">/templates/current_template/css/template.css</p>
<p>In this case, there is already an entry for <em><strong>pre, .code</strong> </em>so we simply need to replace the style elements with our new ones above. Additionally, depending on your template, you may also have other instances of <em><strong>pre, .code</strong> </em>in other style sheets. To determine if this is the case either take a look at the source code of your page and see what style sheets are being called, or look at the template setting in the admin panel to see if there are any additional themes in use, in my case there was an additional style sheet overriding the main one.</p>
<p class="code">/templates/current_template/styles/background/purewhite/css/editor.css</p>
<p>Simply comment out or remove <em><strong>pre, .code</strong> </em>in the overriding style sheet. Now when the page is served to the browser, the correct style is applied. There is, however, one caveat to this - the new editor.css style sheet, supersedes the default one previously used, so any style elements that used to be listed in the styles drop down, will now be missing. To overcome this you can copy them from the system style sheet into your new editor.css</p>

	  <p>This is a great little tip for showing hidden files in OSX. Normally all files are hidden, and so access to the hidden unix filesystem is not possible. This is easily overcome however. You can either permanently disable this feature by running the following command in terminal.</p>
<p class="code">defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES</p>
<p>or, if you need to change the visibility on a regular basis the following may be of more help</p>
<p>Open up the apple script editor and paste in the following code</p>
<p class="code">try<br /> <br /> set dotVisible to do shell script "defaults read com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles"<br /> <br />on error errorMessage number errorNumber<br /> <br /> set dotVisible to 0<br /> <br />end try<br /><br />if dotVisible = "0" then<br /> <br /> do shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles 1"<br /> <br />else<br /> <br /> do shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles 0"<br /> <br />end if<br /><br />tell application "Finder" to quit<br /><br />delay 1<br /><br />tell application "Finder" to activate</p>
<p>Now save this as an application - call it something like 'toggle_hidden_folders'</p>
<p>Clicking on the toggle_hidden_folders.app now toggles the visibility of hidden files and folders.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/dmcms/2010/02/27/dmcms-lost-and-forgotten.html">DMCMS Lost and forgotten?</a></h2>
	  <p>Development on DMCMS has laid dormant for a while, and to most it probably seems like it has been abandoned. Work commitments, managing websites, becoming a father, running my own business, renovating a house, building a car or two, plus various other projects take up lots of time, and I end up finding that I have none left to do things like develop DMCMS.</p>
<p>Last year I actually picked up from where I had left off and rewrote the current 0.7.6 version to release it as a branch of the main code - `DMCMS Light Version 1`. A lot of progress was also made on the Version 0.8.0 code, with many features production ready. Unfortunately we suffered a break in at our premises, and both the laptop the code was developed on, and the backup drive were stolen. Unfortunately, as a result of this, all of the development files were lost, as I had not committed any changes to CVS.</p>
<p>Having just updated the site, I just noticed that most of the work on the 0.7.6 release was uploaded here - the old site was running from it as it was one of my live test sites. So with a little work, I should be able to get back to the same status - a production ready version 1. At this stage I am not completely sure what status the code is at - there may have been other untested changes that were lost, but the main part of the re-write - a change in file structure - is very obviously still intact. When I get time, I will have an audit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the theft, and the loss of most of 0.8.0 has now made me have a bit of a rethink about what to do with it, and at present, I am not sure whether I will continue. There is simply too much ground to make up. If anything, a full rewrite might be both a quicker option, and one that brings DMCMS up to date. There are a lot of well thought out aspects of DMCMS, but there are many aspects that do not lend themselves well to managing a user-base, and extensibility - both things that were not considered way back in 2004 when I first started writing it.</p>
<p>There are a lot of lessons learned, and there have also been many advances with technology in the past 6 years, and whilst I may not have the actual code written - There is always a complete CMS mapped out in my head - I just need to figure out how to get it into my laptop as typing it simply takes too long. Roll on Bio-Data-Link. :)</p>
<p>So, whilst talking of lessons learned - there is one that I can impart for free in the hope that someone else does not suffer the same fate that I did. External hard drives are a wonder of technology - for those of use who have been around for a while, we would never have thought it possible that you could get 500Gb or even 1Tb in a portable drive enclosure - storage that is in addition to your main hard drive (my first computer had 16k RAM - and that was it - lol).</p>
<p>So using an external hard drive as a backup drive is perfect - especially with something like time machine on the Mac - plus with a Macbook what better way to backup - you even get to do it on the road. Perfect! Or is it??</p>
<p>When my laptop was stolen, the backup drive was stolen as well - mostly as it was plugged into the Macbook. Whilst this is fine for data integrity (it's unlikely that both hard drives will fail) it's not so good for security. So my tip for today is never leave your back drive and laptop in the same location. Obvious? maybe, but I never considered that someone would go to the lengths they did to steal mine.</p>
<p>Just my 02c for today.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/mac%20how%20to's/2010/02/27/vmware-fusion-increase-virtual-machine-size.html">VMware Fusion - Increase virtual machine size</a></h2>
	  <p>Like many ex M$ Windows users, I still have the occasional need to use it to run programs on that will not run under OSX. For example, probably all of the programs I use for PLC programming simply will not run natively on the Mac. This leaves me with two options - carry round another laptop (sometimes happens), or use a virtual machine.</p>
<p>A job I did recently for a client required I install some additional windows based software, to program the obscure controller that they had. At the time I just had my Mac on me, so I powered up Vmware and started to install the code. Unfortunately the installation started to hang about half way though - the issue was a nearly full disc.</p>
<p>I keep my virtual disc size fairly lean - the work I do is quite storage intensive, requiring lots of space, so I tend not to waste space if I can avoid it. It's easy enough to resize the disc if necessary. So that is what I did. Fortunately I am usually prepared for these things as you never know what will happen when you are stuck working in the middle of nowhere,</p>
<p>A friend of mine, just emailed me to ask how to change the disc size, so I thought I might as well add it up here</p>
<p>Pre-requisites - Ubuntu install CD + enough spare room on hard drive</p>
<ol>
<li>BACK UP YOUR VIRTUAL MACHINE</li>
<li>To make bigger you need to delete all snapshots</li>
<li>Then you will be able to alter the size of the drive in VMWare settings by typing in a new value. This is greyed out if the Virtual Machine is running or a snapshot exists.</li>
<li>So now you have increased disc size but your virtual machine still only see's the partision size it was installed on. Next you have to extend the partitions allocated size to include the extra 'physical' size you just gave the virtual disc. NOTE - you can see this in disc manager under admin tools in windows, but you will not be able to change the partition size for the primary disc.</li>
<li>Fear not - There are many ways to do this, but best for me was to use Ubuntu (all ways are a variation on similar theme - just choose your flavour of Linux)</li>
<li>Download Ubuntu (www.ubuntu.com)</li>
<li>Burn image to a CD</li>
<li>Boot up your virtual machine with Ubuntu CD in it so that it boots into Ubuntu live mode (don't install anything - just run from the CD).</li>
<li>Then in system tools there is a partition utility called 'gparted' - open it</li>
<li>You will see your virtual disc, with the unallocated space to right side - allocate this unused space to your virtual drive.</li>
<li>Shut down Ubuntu + eject disc</li>
<li>Reboot virtual machine - DO NOT SKIP THE DISK CHECK</li>
<li>Reboot again</li>
<li>Your virtual machine should now be the full allocated size.</li>
</ol>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2010/02/25/times-a-changing.html">Times a Changing</a></h2>
	  <p>The site migration is pretty much finished, with just a few small odds and ends to fix up. One of the things that I have left to do is to add in some re-directions for the old content. When moving content it is always a good idea to redirect visitors to the new location with a 403 error response to the users browser. This will in turn be trawled by the web crawlers and your new location duly noted. As the old content locations followed the navigation structure of the old site code, I can add in one or two rules in my htaccess file using mod_rewrite and regex to redirect users from specific areas of the old site.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that the new site no longer runs from DMCMS, and whilst I do feel more than a little guilty about this, I simply did not have the time to integrate shopping carts, trouble ticket systems, forums and user handling into the DMCMS core. It was much quicker and easier to use existing products. Plus, the idea with DMCMS is that it is a simple and easy to use CMS, so integration of additional third party software does not fit with the idea behind it.</p>
<p>The online store is now up and running, although there is currently only one product (DMCMS) this is just for testing purposes. I will add in the premium mods as I develop them. All mods are instantly downloadable on checkout. There are one or two mods for Dolphin 7 already in the works, with more planned to come.Purchasers of premium mods also get access to the helpdesk system for dedicated support.</p>
<p>There are free mods available from the Resources &gt; Tutorial section, this is basically the 'How To' section from the old site, that has now been categorized, I will add hints and tips here as I get time. There are a bunch of mods I developed for Dolphin 6 that I need to convert into proper mod format. My ultimate idea is to strike a balance between free mods and paid mods.</p>
<p>Long term visitors will remember that we used to run PHPBB forums here a few years back, but these were closed down due to spammers (there were more spammers than users - lol). Well, we now have new forums, both for the support of DMCMS, and also for supporting the mod community and the products and services we offer here on deeemm.com. If you would like to see a particular category considered, just let me know.</p>
<p>One of the best new features, and the main feature for DMCMS version 8, is comments. If you check below this post, you now have the ability to leave me a reply, this is something that I should have added to the site years ago, as my ramblings would probably have been made a little more interesting with the input of others. So, don't be shy - leave a reply ;)</p>
<p>There's still other stuff to do, the demo site still needs to be put back up and running and the links pages need to be transferred, which I will hopefully be tackling over the next few days. If there are any articles missing, or info that you cannot find, please let me know and i will track them down for you.</p>

<p>The issue is a CSS issue. Basically the style applied to the P tag by TinyMCE and D7 are different - so it displays OK in the editor, but when the D7 code renders it - it is displayed differently.</p>
<p>The offending code is in templates/base/css/general.css, the attribute margin:0px is applied to the P tag, remove this and the issue will be gone, BUT there is one caveat - obviously this affects ALL instances of the P tag - so it may be that whilst this cures the immediate issue, it may cause problems elsewhere (i've not tested this, and this may be different for your site - depending on which template you use and what modifications you have applied to them)</p>
<p>To fix the issue, you will need to change general.css in two places -</p>
<p>Line 1</p>
<p>Change</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="caption"><strong><em class="code">a img, form, p</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to</p>
<pre class="code" style="padding-left: 30px;">a img, form</pre>
<p>and on line 120</p>
<p>change</p>
<p class="code" style="padding-left: 30px;">p<br /> {<br /> margin:0px;<br /> padding:0px;<br /> }</p>
<p>to</p>
<p class="code" style="padding-left: 30px;">p<br /> {<br /> padding:0px;<br /> }</p>
<p>There is no real need to apply the attributes to the P as has been done in the original code, plus declaring the base P tag in two different places can lead to inheritance issues.</p>
<p>If it turns out that removing these elements has too much of a knock on effect on other areas of the site, then The best solution may be to alter the TinyMCE css to match the D7 general by adding the margin:0px to plugins/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/skins/default/content.css At least then what you see will actually be what you get</p>

	  <p>Welcome to the new look DeeEmm website. The site has been re-developed to match a change in focus for our core business, by redirecting web based enquiries made at our main company to the DeeEmm site. The promotion of DeeEmm as a sales brand is to both provide a location for the promotion of our web services division, and also putting an existing resource to better use. What was once just my tech blog, will now become an online resource for providing web services and products. Along with the change in focus for the site, the business aspect of the change will also follow, with DeeEmm will now be run as a subsidiary of my main company. The split setup will allow a focus on web based products and services to be maintained as a separate entity from the main company endeavors, and will encompass a variety of products and services ranging from basic web design, and website management, to more technical solutions, such as remote PLC monitoring, and embedded web based control and monitoring systems.</p>
<p>The new site includes features specifically geared toward the online supply and support of products in a digital medium, for both providing and supporting web based sales of software modifications, plugins and extensions, and allowing instant access to purchased products. The online store provides a convenient method by which customers can purchase and download products and the trouble ticket system provides support for installation and usage issues that may occur. We also offer a full knowledge-base of past issues for users to search.</p>
<p>We will also offer design for other mediums, such as print, packaging and photography, as well as other electronic and non-electronic formats.</p>
<p>The forums have now been reinstated, and subscribers also have access to private forums where dedicated support can be given.</p>

Previously i had used EMMA on Linux, but as I only has my macbook to hand I decided to have a look into what was available.<br /><br />A quick google turned up Sequel Pro - an open source project - <a href="http://www.sequelpro.com/" title="http://www.sequelpro.com/">http://www.sequelpro.com/</a></p>
<p>Sequel Pro is a very capable tool, that works flawlessly, it supports SSL connections and had a wide range of encoding options. The layout is instantly familiar to anyone who is used to using phpMyAdmin, and the interface is pretty intuitive to use.</p>
<p>The query editor allows easy query management with both a history feature as well as a favourites menu to keep track of your more frequently used querys, this alone is a great feature for anyone who needs to use the same querys over and over. The query editor also provides basic text editor functionality and syntax highlighting to make life a littel easier, it also includes auto complete.</p>
<p>Overall, if you need a remote database client, or simply want to use something other than phpMyAdmin, I would reccomend Sequel Pro. A great application, at a great price.</p>

	  <p>If you would like to utilise the inbuilt banner manager in Dolphin, you are stuck with the locations lais out in the templates. Sure you can move the banners to another position within the template files, but what about if you wanted the advert to appear in it's own block? Well, here's how...<br /><br />To add the banners to a block you will need to add a PHP block - to to this simply drag one into the desired position in the page builder in the admin panel. I've added one to the left column on the homepage. Rename it with something meaningfull - i named mine 'advertisement' :D<br /><br />Now here's the tricky part... You will need to directly edit the database to be able to add your PHP code. I personally use phpMyAdmin, but there are many other database editors out there.<br /><br />So fire up your favourite database tool and go to the 'PageCompose' table and search / browse for your newly added block.<br /><br />Now add the following PHP code to the 'Content' field<br /><br /><span class="code">echo banner_put_nv(2);</span></p>
<p>(the number 2 relates to the left block - 1, 3 and 4 relate to the top, right and bottom blocks repsectively)</p>
<p>If you are using the borderless block mod - you will also need to wrap this in a div and give it a height as it will overlap the content below it.</p>
<p>Now, once you've entered this- go back to the admin panel and move your newly created block to another position - and then move it back to the desired position. This clears the cache - if you don't do this - your new block will not display. Now navigate to your homepage and check out your new banner ads in a block.</p>
<p>With your banners now displayed in a block you might want to go and comment out the old banner calls in the template - these can be found in _header.html and _footer.html. To remove the left banner, open _header.html and look for the following tag</p>
<p class="code">__banner_left__</p>
<p>either delete it or comment it out to prevent the banner from appearing in the standard position.</p>

	  <p>One thing that Dolphin 6 lacks is a decent way for users and admin to be able to add images to posts<br /><br />This is now available with the ezfilemanager plugin for tinyMCE - <a href="http://www.webnaz.net/ezfilemanager/" title="http://www.webnaz.net/ezfilemanager/">http://www.webnaz.net/ezfilemanager/</a> <br /><br />To get this up and running you should do the following...<br /> <br /> Down load the EzFileManager plugin from the link above and then copy the plugin files to</p>
<p><br /> <br /> <span class="code">/plugins/tinymce/plugins/</span><br /> </p>
<p>Now you need to edit the configuration file</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="code">/ezfilemanager/includes/config.inc.php</p>
<p>Basically you need to set the paths for your installation - this will be as follows... <br /><br /></p>
<pre>define("WN_URL","http://yoursite.com/");//your domain  url <br />define('WN_PATH','/full/path/to/your/site/');//domain root  absolute path</pre>
<p>If they do not exist, you will also need to create the follwing folders... '/images/', '/docs/' and '/media/' you might also want to consider changing these from the standard locations.</p>
<p>Now you need to add the call for EzFileManager into the tinymce.init for the pages you want it to appear on, for me this is just the admin page so I edited /inc/classes/BxDolPageviewAdmin.php to include the following...<br /> <br /> After the function for tinyMCE_GZ.init but before the closing script tag add the following...<br /> </p>
<p class="code">function ezfilemanager (field_name, url, type, win) {<br />var PluginPath = "/plugins/tiny_mce/plugins/ezfilemanager/ezfilemanager.php";<br />if (PluginPath.indexOf("?") &lt; 0)<br />{<br />PluginPath = PluginPath + "?type=" + type;<br />} else {<br />PluginPath = PluginPath + "&amp;type=" + type;<br />}<br />tinyMCE.activeEditor.windowManager.open({</p>
<p>Then add the following calls within both tinyMCE_GZ.init and tinyMCE.init functions.</p>
<p><br /> <br /> <span class="code">file_browser_callback : "ezfilemanager", relative_urls : false,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should now be able to access the image upload part of EzFileManager by clicking on the new button created in the image dialog on admin pages.</p>
<p>You can also add a button for EzFileManager by including 'ezfilemanager' in the list of plugins - accessing EzFileManager via the dedicated button will also allow access to the file manager aspect of the code.</p>
<p>If you want to also add it for users you will need to modify the relevent files to include same modifications within headers - To do this search for tinymce.init and determine which files need to be modified.</p>
<p>I have not added it for my users as there is no security and no differentiation between the files uploaded for each user (all files are saved in the same place) this means that all users have access to everyone else's files - not good for my site where some users may be members of private groups.</p>

	  <p>Just a very quick tutorial this time.<br /><br />i was looking for a way to create a block that didn't have the normal border and header so that I could add in my own custom HTML. After looking through the code, this is very easy to do - in fact it doesn;t even really need a modification (well not in the traditional sense of the word).<br /><br />Basically what you need to do is this...<br /><br /></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Page Builder in the admin interface</li>
<li>Create a block by dragging the 'Simple HTML' sample into position.</li>
<li>Add your HTML / text etc, give it a meaningful caption and save it</li>
<li>Now you will need to get access to your database by using something like phpMyAdmin.</li>
<li>Go to the 'Page Compose' table and find the entry for your newly added block - TIP look for the same caption</li>
<li>Now edit this record so that the value of 'Design Box' is 0</li>
<li>Now you can checkout your new border-less block by viewing your site in a browser.</li>

	  <div id="105" class="post_text">
<p>One thing that has always bugged me about my dolphin site, is that it always shows me events that are waaaay waaaay in the future - This is of little use as it hides the upcoming events - practically meaning that no one knows what is happening in the coming days / weeks / months / etc.</p>
<p>This is easily fixed with a quick hack.</p>
<p>To display events so that they show from the next upcoming event onward...</p>
<p class="code">Edit /inc/classes/BxDolEvents.php</p>
<p>At approximately line 2242 you will see the following</p>
<p class="code"><strong><em> switch ($sOrder) {</em></strong></p>
<p>This selects the appendage to the SQL statement retrieving the events from the database. The default case select statement is 'latest'.</p>
<p>To change the behaviour, we simply replace this case with</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong><span class="code"> $sOrderS = "AND `EventStart` BETWEEN NOW() AND NOW()+ INTERVAL 362 DAY ORDER BY `EventStart` ASC";</span></strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the Events Block will show the next event in time and those after it up to a year away (or the three or so events that the block is allowed to show)</p>
<p>To do this mod properly, ideally another case should be added for 'upcoming' and the relevent code added where required to add another tab to the block - this way the user could select to view upcoming events, latest events or a random selection.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/uex.jpg" border="0" alt="uex.jpg" title="UEX" hspace="20" vspace="5" width="173" height="152" align="left" />It's a very exciting time in the DeeEmm office, we have been made part of the beta team for UEX - yes, that's right - UEX - the Linux version of Ultraedit - the long awaited port of Ultraedit to the Linux platform.<br /><br />The new Ultraedit for Linux is nearing the release date and a few lucky users have been chosen as beta testers - We were lucky to be one of those.</p>
<p>First impressions of UEX are exactly as expected. UEX is very similar visually to UEDIT and UEStudio. It differs in that there are a few features that are missing or different, but it likely that these will appear with the final release.<br /><br />We've been using Ubuntu 9.04 to run the UEX beta on, and we've been using it for the current re-write / tidying of the DMCMS version 1 release. So far our findings with UEX are pretty much as expected with a beta release, mostly the code works as expected, but with the occasional bug / hangup. Hopefully our dilligence with reporting the errors will mean that RC1 will as robust we have all come to expect Ultraedit to be, and that the final release of UEX is not too far behind it.</p>
<p>There are also rumors of a mac port of UEX, although there is no timeline currently available for it. My guess is that once UEX is up and running it will be little matter to port it to the mac platform.</p>
<p>The version 1 release for DMCMS has been delayed to include some new developments, including the addition of an all new tiny_mce and image browser and the seperation of the administration functions from the main code, this will allow faster page load times and also increase security. It's maybe a little different from our original goal of getting the version 1 release out into the wild, but we figured the extra wait would be worth it.</p>
<p>We will keep you posted on both UEX and DMCMS version 1.</p>

	  <p>Using Boonex Dolphin software can be a bit taxing on your patience, there are many idiosynchracy's that alter the way that Dolphin works from how you would expect most 'normal' scripts to function. One of these is the way that it displays forum posts within groups, blogs and on the main page.</p>
<p>Like many sites, forum posts are aggregated in RSS feeds, different feeds are available for different users, groups, forums and categories. The feeds are available to anyone who wants to view them. Unfortunately Boonex have decided that they should use the same feeds to aggregate data within the site, whilst this may seem like a great idea on the outside, it does however introduce problems on some servers.</p>
<p>So you have installed Dolphin and are now stuckk looking at te spinning icon that tells you the latest forums posts are loading.. and loading... and loading. In fact it seems that they will never load.</p>
<p>This can be one of two things.</p>
<p><a class="link" href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/filesystem.configuration.php#ini.allow-url-fopen">allow_url_fopen</a> is not enabled on your server. This can be enabled via php.ini if your server allows php.ini at runtime. (php.ini within local directories)</p>
<p>or...</p>
<p>If allow_url_open is enabled, then it is likely that your host does not allow circular references - ie you cannot call your domain url from within your domain in an fopen transaction. My host is setup like this - they refuse to change it claiming security as a reason, I think it's because they are missing the reference to my domain in their hosts file and are too dumb to be able to fix it - but that's besides the point. (Host - if you are reading this - please fix this issue.)</p>
<p>You can test this by posting the RSS feed URL directly into your browser, if it works the problem&nbsp;is most likely because your host is preventing loopback URL's - ie won't allow local scripts to access the fully qualified name.</p>
<p>Eg the URL for your RSS feed will be something like http://yoursite.com/inc/classes/BxRSS.php?your-rss-info but your host will not allow you to call http://yoursite.com from within your server (if that makes sense).</p>
<p>The usual solution is to use relative paths instead ie ../../inc/classes/BxRSS.php?your-rss-info but the htaccess url rewrite for pretty urls mucks these up (or it needs an entry to handle local paths added).</p>
<p>I also have this problem and it's a tad annoying that they should process local feeds this way. But life sucks and I'm used to it.</p>
<p>There is however half a solution - this is to aggregate your feeds on another site by using a script and then call this script instead. I say half a solution as this does not account for user verification and so cannot access feeds for hidden groups etc. But the hidden groups degrade nicely - there is simply nothing shown, and the link to the forums still appears.</p>
<p>There was a post over at Boonex that outlined one solution you could use, including a script. The script was quite large and did not solve the verification issue. I decided to see if I could improve on this and ended up with the following. Simply paste the following into a text file and name it feedbouncer.php then save it to a different server from your Dolphin site</p>
<p class="code"><!--?php <br ?-->echo (readfile($_GET['feed']));<br />?&gt;</p>
<p>Then - making a note of the RSS feed's URL that you require in the admin panel of Dolphin, it will be something like -</p>
<p class="code">http://yoursite.com/inc/classes/BxRSS.php?your-rss-info</p>
<p>Simply replace it with the following (replace the urls with those that you require)</p>
<p class="code">http://your-different-site.com/path-to/feedbouncer.php?feed=http://yoursite.com/inc/classes/BxRSS.php?your-rss-info</p>
<p>In essence it just echo's back the url. (You can test it by typing the url directly into your browser)</p>
<p>Simple huh? :)</p>
<p>Be aware that this may / may not work depending on the settings of the second server</p>
<p>It is worth noting that you can also use this script to perform further actions on the feed - I have used this on other sites to harvest feeds, pages and add / filter data. This can be easily done by loading the feed or page into a variable and then editing it using basic text manipulation techniques such as string replace.</p>
<p>ie -</p>
<p class="code">$feed = readfile($_GET['feed']);<br />$new_feed = str_replace('old text', 'new text', $feed);<br />echo $new_feed</p>
<p>This can be expanded much much further using more complex manipulation techniques such as regular expressions. Some stuff I have written before using these techniques include ebay harvesters, weather harvesters, news feed harvesters, even automatic translators. the techniques is always the same - read the page into a string, manipulate the string, use / echo the result.</p>

Something that i have never really been able to completely replace on either the Mac or Linux platform was my favoured editor - Ultraedit. Deep down I have a soft spot for Uedit, and whilst it can be a little bloated for simple tasks, years of useage and tweaking to my liking made it my favourite tool for all kinds of development work.<br /><br />Gedit on the Linux platform, once endowed with a few useful plugins, becomes a useable tool for web development. The inclusion of tools such as the 'Class Browser' (http://www.stambouliote.de/projects/gedit_plugins.html), 'Symbol Browser' (http://symbol-browser.sourceforge.net), 'Word Completion' (http://users.tkk.fi/~otsaloma/gedit) and 'Find in Files', makes Gedit a really useful editor, which whilst not really feature packed is more than capable, which is excellent for the standard packaged editor that is supplied with the Gnome desktop.<br /><br />For the Mac, there are quite a few editors out there, some free some not, none are really on par with Ultraedit featurewise, but this could be seen as a plus in some respects. I was quite happy using TextMate for web development work, especially as it had plugins available for code browsing and project handling, that is, until I found Coda.<br /><br />Coda, takes up where other editors on the Mac finish, and whilst it may only be aimed at web development, it includes everything that you might need in the day to day life of a web dev.<br /><br />Coda integrates the most useful programs all into one single IDE, it includes project management, an FTP client, text editor, preview window, css editor, SVN client and even a terminal window for remote access to your web server.<br /><br />The Project management features allows you to keep local and remote server details, as well as FTP and SSH login details all together, meaning that when working on a project it is easy to upload / download files, check the results of your work in the inbuilt browser, edit css etc. There is even a built in book library that includes books for HTML, Javascript, CSS and PHP, There is also the ability to add more if you so wish. The in built code navigator allows quick access to classes and functions, and with the addition of a few extra plugins you can also validate your PHP code, and perform other actions such as HTML tidying and url encoding. All of this is in addition to the standard expcted features of any decent editor such as tabbed MDI, syntax highlighting, find in files, text commenting, text conversion and even split window editing.<br /><br />Coda is not a free application, but does offer a free demo. If you're in the market for a decent development platform for web apps, then give Coda a try, I'm sure that you will not be&nbsp; dissapointed.<br /><br />Coda is available from Panic software at <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/" title="http://www.panic.com/coda/">http://www.panic.com/coda/</a> <br /><br />DM</p>

	  <p>{jcomments on}</p>
<p>After discussing template editing on another site, and how easy / hard it is to change the look and feel of your site to make it your own. I decided that in my opinion, the whole process is fairly simply to do but requires that you have knowledge of a few skills and a few tools to hand to help you out.</p>
<p>This is a basic outline of what to do and how to do it, use it as a guide to get you started on style modification, and applied to all sites using css and html.</p>
<p>First things first - lets cover the REAL basic stuff - not that anyone wanting to do this kind of stuff should be that much of a novice (you need at least half a clue), but more to emphasize the RIGHT way to do things. There are rules laid down by W3C and we should all do our best to read, understand and apply them.</p>
<p><strong>Semantics</strong></p>
<p>What are semantics?? Semantics, when used in the context of the the web, are a set of design principles that cover how data should be conveyed to the user, it promotes the ideal that data and style should be treated as separate entities.</p>
<p>The ideal of a semantic web is a web that can be easily read by programs - a web where data is easy to retrieve from the page - the traditional embedded / inline style information used by many coders is not very friendly and is not a very data-centric way of doing things.</p>
<p>The correct way to convey data is by using one file for your markup and one file for your style. This way only the data is stored in the markup file making it easier to retrieve - easier to retrieve by browser crawlers, easier to aggregate, easier to write mods for easier to do anything that requires taking the data and converting it or processing it.</p>
<p>Only when the data is sent to a humanly readable browser does it need the style information - so that the browser knows how to present the data so that a human can process it.</p>
<p>Creating and maintaining a website to comply with the latest web standards is both gratifying and also ensuring that your website will display correctly in all future browsers (except IE but more about that later).</p>
<p><strong>So what do I do?</strong></p>
<p>Without creating a long boring rhetoric about the whys and why-nots I will simply say that you should not use CSS in your HTML docs, you should not use HTML style elements such as , etc.., and ALL of your style information should be in a seperate CSS file (or XSL in the case of XML).</p>
<p><strong>HTML or XML?</strong></p>
<p>XML is the natural progression of HTML - the style elements have been removed and it is extensible - meaning you can create your own elements and attributes&nbsp; perfect for storing data (which is what is was invented for) XML / XSL is the perfect way to code the semantic web and my guess is that eventually HTML will probably be phased out</p>
<p><strong>Tools - you promised us tools...</strong></p>
<p>With the basic understanding of the separation of content and style, you will now realise that to be able to modify your site, you need to look in two places. (two seperate files)</p>
<p>So how do you know where to look? this is where the tools come in to play.</p>
<p>First up, I will simply say that if you want to be successfull at doing this you will need to use Firefox. Forget using Internet Explorer as a developing and testing envoironment - you are doing yourself no favours - it is not standards compliant and will cause you untold headaches - always develop for Firefox and then fix up your code for the other browsers it's a lot less painfull.</p>
<p>Firefox also has the tools that we require. Other browsers also have some tools but they're simply not as good, plus Firefox has been at the forefront of puching web standards for many years now - they deserve the support.</p>
<p>Not only this but the tools we need are free!! (everyone loves free stuff)</p>
<p>After installing Firefox you will need to install the following plugins</p>
<p><strong>Firebug</strong> - Firebug is the best tool you will use for modding websites. Full Stop.</p>
<p><strong>WebDeveloper</strong> - A great toolbar / DOM inspector and a perfect companion to Firebug.</p>
<p>You also might like...</p>
<p><strong>FireFTP</strong> - Excellent FTP Client - embedded into Firefox it makes the perfect test environment.</p>
<p>You can Install the tools from the tools menu in the browser.</p>
<p>You will also need a decent programmers text editor - this will differ greatly from platform to platform, eveyone has thier favourite and they are mostly as useable as each other. I would say for a web developer you need to consider the following.</p>
<p>Syntax Highlighting - makes code easier to work with</p>
<p>Project management - good for managing websites</p>
<p>FTP - For working with remote file</p>
<p>PHP syntax checking - very useful for debugging php code</p>
<p>Function / Class browser - good for quickly navigating code files</p>
<p>Most importantly - even if it does NONE of the above - you must be able to search for text within files.</p>
<p><strong>So how do I do this - you promised skillz</strong></p>
<p>Putting all of this together is easy - very easy.</p>
<p>First - lets add a button to Firefox's toolbar - Right clickthe toolbar and select 'customize' Now drag Firebugs 'Inspect Element' button to the toolbar - it;s the one that looks like a pair of glasses - drag the Web Developer button there too.</p>
<p>Now you're set!</p>
<p><br /><strong>Searching for CSS</strong></p>
<p>Here's an example.</p>
<p>-Navigate to your home page</p>
<p>-Click on the 'inspect' button you just added to the toolbar. You will notice 2 things happen - a window will open at the bottom of the browser showing information about the page - and here's the best bit - as you move your pointer over the page - the info will change to tell you aout the bit you are hovering over and you will also see a nice box aroud the element highlighting it.</p>
<p>WOW!! (If you've never use Firebug before it's pretty impressive!!)</p>
<p>- OK - hover over an element - and then click it - the info in the bottom page will stop changing</p>
<p>- SO - what does all this tell us? The right pane shows us the CSS - it tells us what css file it is in and on what line. It also tells us the name of the element containing the text.<span class="cssSelector"> if you look in the left frame you will see the element in the code, If yoou hover over thie part of the code the element is highlighted on the page</span></p>
<p>WOW!! (Great isn't it).</p>
<p>So to make a change - open up the CSS file (the one displayed in the right hand pane) and searchfor the css elements name. Then you can modify it and save it. Hit refresh on your browser to see the change.</p>
<p>Easy as that.</p>
<p><strong>Searching for markup<br /></strong></p>
<p>After a while you will find this pretty easy and might want to progress to the next level - this will probably be about the same time that you want to modify some of the markup. The CSS files are pretty easy to find, but what about if you want to mod some of the HTML. This is where the text editor comes into it's own.</p>
<p>Remember i mentioned you need a text editor that can search within files - this is why (forget doing this with windows - full text search hasnt worked properly since they introduced the nodding dog back in Win98).</p>
<p>- Find the element you want to modify using the inspector (as above)</p>
<p>- copy a portion of the code - don't choose any changeable / dynamially generated content, choose a HTML element / style tag</p>
<p>- Using your text editor - perform a search in files - this may net only one result, it may return many - to test which one is right you may need to modify the file by placing a marker in it - perhaps the word 'test'</p>
<p>- Save the file</p>
<p>- Refresh your browser</p>
<p>- inspect the element again to see if it has the word 'test' in it. If it has you've found your file - if not try again.</p>
<p>- once you have located your file you can then mod it as necessary.</p>
<p>- you get the idea....</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>With a little practice you will easily be able to find and mod any style element on your site, CSS is mostly self explanatory, it is in plain text for the most part. If you're not sure - just change it to test what it does - you can always change it back again.</p>
<p>There are lots of CSS reference sites on the web - you will find them invaluable - use them.</p>
<p><strong>Aditional Tools and Info</strong></p>
<p>What text editor??? ask 10 people and you will get 10 different answers.</p>
<p>I've used many over the years, but here are my faves</p>
<p>Windows - Ultraedit / Ultraedit Studio (soon to be ported to Mac / Linux)</p>
<p>Linux - Gedit (Standard editor under Gnome desktop) / Jedit (java based)</p>
<p>Mac - TextMate / Jedit / Coda</p>
<p>Jedit is free and very capable but looks clunky (IMO)</p>
<p>Eclipse IDE is also free although Eclipse is a little bloated for just a text editor. If you want to use Eclipse (its Multi Platform) make sure you install the PDT (PHP Development Tools plugin) Eclipse is actually a full on IDE for java, c+, ruby, etc... Steer away from the Pulse package if you can - it's very slow to load - look for the PDT project pages. It also has an SVN CVS plugin too.</p>
<p>Uedit is a very capable programmers editor and also comes with project management, FTP and SVN CVS control - (Uestudio is basically the same but a full on development IDE) I used Uedit for 10 years before leaving Windows.</p>
<p>Coda is one of the best tools I've used - aimed at web design only, it includes FTP / SVN CVS / Project management + CSS inspector but it only available for the Mac. It's simple and nice to use - also includes a built in terminal emulator.</p>
<p>The choice is yours but choose wisely and it will make your life much easier.</p>

	  <p>It's been a little while since I've posted anything here, my time has been taken up with other projects which has left me with very little time to work on the CMS or update the site. You would probably have noticed that the proposed version 8 is currently on hold (see DMCMS news), this is likely to stay like this for the foreseeable future, I simply have too much work on a present which means something has to give. There have been a few minor updates to the DMCMS release whch will be combined into the next release - Version 1 !!!!<br /><br />The code has been in regular use on many sites now and has proven to work reliably enough to wear the Version 1 badge. This means that the whole thing will be repackaged and supplied slightly differently from previous releases. The database layout will be the same but the table prefix will be shortened. there will be a conversion script for the previous versions database but it is reccomended to simply reinstall the software. For this reason there will be no update path from the current version to Version 1.<br /><br />The new version will hopefully be up within the coming weeks.<br /><br />One of the other project's I have been working on is a social networking site, this is still in it's early development stages but is up and running and utilising a social networking product called Dolphin. Dolphin is a PHP / SQL&nbsp; and AJAX powered site that was initially designed to power dating sites. Dolphin has progressed in recent years and now can be modified quite easily to work with any type of social networking site. The dating specific features can be disabled or modified to be more suitable to the sites content. I may post more about Dolphin over the course of the project so if you're a dolphin user or need some help with your Dolphin site be sure to check back.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2008/12/02/how-to-pass-it-on.html">How To Pass It On</a></h2>
	  <p>This week has been an interesting time in the Linux driven portion of the household. After struggling with my HTPC in the lounge getting slower and slower, it was finally taking longer to boot up than I had patience - which meant that I had to find some time to have a look at it. <br /><br />I put the machine together a few years back, it's based on an old Asus A7N8X Deluxe MOBO running an AMD Athlon XP 1250 that I fitted into an Origen AE case. I installed XP Media Centre on it and pretty much left it at that - that is until I decided to try and fix it.<br /><br />I tried all of the usual suspects - but none made any difference, I ended up trying a repair from the install disk, but the problem with XP MCE is that the media centre part is a hacked on extension to Win XP and not really part of the core. Needless to say - the recovery didn't fix it either,<br /><br />So left with the choice of a complete reinstallation or updating to Vista I decided to look elsewhere. The XP install would be relatively painless but as support will no doubt end soon upgrading is the sensible option. The only problem with that is that Vista is not really much of an upgrade- I had it on my laptop for less than a week and then junked all Micro$oft apps in favour of open source alternatives - Ubuntu / Open Office etc.</p>
<p>On the subject of Windows... Being a long time user of windows (3.11 &gt; 95 &gt; 98 &gt; 2000 &gt; XP) The transfer from 2000 to XP was a big step. I abstained from changing to XP for a long time as it had a lot of issues running the software that I used (IDE's for Industrial Robot and PLC programming). I nicknamed XP 'Windows for Girls' as it seemed to have no real benefit over earlier versions apart from the horrible little animated icons that automatically appeared to tell you how to do something that you already knew how to do. Whilst it may have looked more polished around the edges, it did not run that much better. It also gave me headaches by forcing me to migrate from a perfectly good VB6 to VB.Net.</p>
<p>The most amusing thing with XP was that not long after it was released SP1 appeared to fix massive seciurity issues (XP was advertised as more secure / faster / etc) The irony was that the patch to fix the security issues slowed the machine down massively and also broke most of the software that was released as XP compatible (afforementioned IDE's etc). As a result many of us ran XP without the SP1 update for quite a while.</p>
<p>When I bought my most recent laptop it came pre-installed with Vista. So I decided to give it a go.</p>
<p>If XP was 'Windows for Girls' Vista was like 'Windows for Danny La Rue'</p>
<p>(As you can tell, I didn't take very well to Vista)</p>
<p>I use my PC for work, it needs to be a productive working envoironment, I use a lot of shortcut keys, rarely use the mouse (it's almost impossible to use a mouse when your laptop is perched on top of a machine in the middle of a factory and a touchpad simply isn't productive - I get frustrated watching people struggle to line the pointer up and click on something when pressing a key would be easier) the very last thing I need from an operating system is things to make it look prettier. This especially enfuriated me when I have to wait for the OS to do something like a search in files (which incidently hasn't really worked since properly windows 2000. I hate having to wait for the PC to catch up when copying data between multiple file instances - (how can I be quicker than the PC at selecting a block of text in one window, changing to another winndow and pasting it???) These are simple operations - the last thing I need is a nodding dog.</p>
<p>Anyway - Rant over...... Vista simply wasn't an option.</p>
<p>I had looked at the various Linux flavoured MCE opponents when I had originally put the machine together, but none really matched up to the XP MCE system. Fortunately this is no longer the case. I recently looked at Linux MCE, but it failed to run correctly on the harware of my test machine (which is a LOT faster than the old ASUS in the HTPC). I toyed with the idea of swapping the MOBO's but the A78NX has digital surround sound and also is a 5 slot board whereas the test machine isn't. I also decided that I wanted to run a RAID 1 setup as I still haven't got around to setting up a central server. I also didn't really want to go out an buy a new machine if I could avoid it.</p>
<p>After a little research I decided on <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/" title="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> . It has a nice XP MCE style theme which should be good for the WAF (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_acceptance_factor" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_acceptance_factor">Wife Acceptance Factor</a> ) and it has plugins to hanldle images and music, which means that it does pretty much what the XP MCE install did.</p>
<p>With all of this in mind I went out and bought two 500Gb SATA drives and set about installing Ubuntu on the machine. I hooked the drives up and installed Ubuntu 8.10 on one of the drives. I tried to install the RAID 1 setup at installation by manually partitioning the drives etc (as outlined in varous how-to's), but unfortunately it did not give me the option to select 'Physical volume for RAID' as the type for the partitions. So after deciding I could always mirror the drives later I installed Ubuntu on one of the drives.<br /><br />I chose Ubuntu as the primary operating system as I use it on my other machines, but also because it makes a good base for MythTV (mythbuntu) which I decided was going to be the new driving force for the HTPC -I am also watching <a href="http://elisa.fluendo.com/" title="http://elisa.fluendo.com/">Elisa</a> with interest - currently it does not offer support for TV cards and recording but this appears to be devloped for a future release.</p>
<p>As usual the Ubuntu installation was completely painless, and after a little hiccup with a <a href="../../?page=how%20to&amp;id=1" title="http://www.deeemm.com/?page=how%20to&amp;id=1">BIOS update</a> to make the board boot from the SATA drives, all the normal stuff simply worked (wireless card, monitor, DVD Re-Writer, networking, etc, etc...)</p>
<p>It was whilst I was fixing up the BIOS issue that I decided I should really post some of my findings on the site to help others. Invariably, problems like this one draw on information from various sources and a few hours work can be saved for others by correlating all of the info and creating some 'how to's - hence the Bios Update how to. My previous contribution to the world wide wobble was DMCMS, but this has slowed recently, taking a back seat to things like fixing teh HTPC and work, so it made sense to try and keep my kudos points high by contributing in a different way.</p>
<p>I am curretly still setting the MythTV box up, at the moment it has one functioning TV card, the Music library and Photos are copied across, the old MCE remote is working, which only really leaves me with setting up a second (and maybe third) TV tuner card and then creating the RAID 1 mirror and setting up the RAID controller (and then moving it from my office back into the lounge).</p>
<p>I will let you know how I get on.</p>
<p>DM.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2008/11/16/whats-new.html">Whats New?</a></h2>
	  <p>It's been along time since I wrote anything to this page, this is mainly due to not having the time to spare to site and get some words together.<br /><br />So, what has been happening in the past four months?<br /><br />The DMCMS (DeeEmm CMS) project has been updated a couple of times, the updates were mainly security related and mostly due to the site being hacked (Damn script kiddies!) The development has been rather slow apart from that. The project has&nbsp; now branched into two seperate versions, with a 'lite' version being available to download from Sourceforge - this is basically the normal version that has been available. The second branch is a version that is incorporating full user and permissions management.<br /><br />The new branch was originally going to be available this year but has now taken a back seat to other projects.<br /><br />The current 'lite' version is currenly still available as a beta version release, but it is likely that this will be released as version 1 before the new year.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Synergy</strong></p>
<p>A great little program I come across that allows you to use one keyboard and mouse for more than one computer is 'Synergy' <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/synergy2/" title="Synergy">http://sourceforge.net/projects/synergy2/</a> Synergy is cross platform compatible and utilises the loacl LAN network to pass mouse and keyboard info between computers. The synergy client needs to be installed on both computers, and then setup to allow one computer (the one with the keyboard and mouse) to be run as the synergy server - the screen positions between both then need to be set and youre then ready.</p>
<p>To switch between computers the mouse is simply moved off of the screen and on to the next computer monitor, in the same way that multiple monitors work.</p>
<p>Cut and paste for text also works between computers.</p>
<p>I have been using this utility for months now - I have thrown away my old KVM switch - which was very klunky and unreliable and now just use Synergy. I use it to share between two Ubuntu machines and an XP machine and have not had a problem (in fact I'm using it to type this!) Synergy will also work with the MAC as well.</p>
<p>Synergy is available for free from the web link above. When using it with Ubuntu, you may need to invoke it from the command line with the command 'sudo synergyc XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX' (replace with the IP address of the synergy server)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cross Platform IDE's</strong></p>
<p>Another thing that I have been looking into is a replacement for Visual Basic.</p>
<p>I have a few projects that Im working on that really need to be ported to the Mac and Linux as well as the Windows platform, this is mostly so that I can support a wider user base, but also because I feel that I should.</p>
<p>I had considered using Java so that it would be platfiorm independent, but just did not like the interface that Java applications tend to have, whilst I'm aware that I can develop my own - it's simply something that I do not have the time to do.</p>
<p>After some searching I came across three candidates - QT (pronounced 'Cute'), wxWidgets and REALbasic.</p>
<p>Installation for all three is availabe through the Synaptics package manager.</p>
<p>Coming from a VB background, getting used to a C++ based language is a little hard at first, this is especially true of QT as yiou are required to do a lot of long hand programming and setting up to get things to work as the IDE only seems to be used to create the interface, it is not used to develop the other projects files - instead these need to be created with a text editor. Compilation also needs to be carried out seperately</p>
<p>wxWidgets, appears to be much the same as QT although the IDE can also be used to edit files</p>
<p>The package that really shines is REALbasic. It is very similar to VB, in both it's layout and operation and integrates the interface designer, editors and compiler in one package.</p>
<p>Applications can be compiled for MAC, Linux or Windows (although the pro version will need to be purchased for a small fee). The only thing that it lacks is a wider range of functions - although these can be added by the purchase and installation of 'Plugin packs'available from 3rd party developers.</p>
<p>I'm currently working on one project to see how it converts, and to see if it is suitable for my other projects</p>
<p>I will let you know how I get on.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2008/07/30/exchange-mail-and-linux-hosting-emma.html">Exchange Mail And Linux Hosting + EMMA</a></h2>
	  <p>Some of you may be aware that I've been setting up a new business - Indau Industrial Automation. Before setting up the new website and email servers I decided that I was going to look for exchange based email hosting packaged with a Linux web server. This would allow me to retain the Windows Mobile smart phone that I currently use and utilise it for push email and OWA Calendar and task synchronising. Having used Push based email for the past year it was high on the list of things to have - even though it meant retaining a tie to Micro$oft.</p>
<p align="justify">Unfortunately there are no comparible solutions available from the open source community yet, There are a few solutions that offer push email from the Linux platform but none that I wanted to risk trying, and none that are as feature rich as the Exchange + Windows mobile solution.</p>
<p align="justify">For the hosting package I looked no further than <a href="http://www.comwebhosting.co.uk/" title="ComWebHosting">ComWebHosting</a> my current service providers - although not advertised they were able to sort out a package that included Linux based web hosting with PHP and SQL along with exchange based Email. ComWebHosting come highly reccomended - I've used them for the past 8 or 9 years and have never had a problem - even now I'm based in Australia, using a UK based hosting company is not a problem - even for push email from my smart phone.</p>
<p align="justify">One new thing to sort out with the web hosting was the SQL database administration. Normally most web hosts provide phpMyAdmin to administer the database, some use other clients but there is normally a way in which you can upload a database backup or run an SQL query. As the sql database server was not the same as the webserver phpMyAdmin was not available so I needed to find a DB client that could be run remotely from the server - allowing me to install it on my local machine but access and administrate the database located on a different server.</p>
<p align="justify">A quick google managed to turn up nothing but a search in the ubuntu synaptics repository brough up EMMA - "extendable mysql managing assistant" (<a href="http://www.fastflo.de/projects/emma" title="EMMA">http://www.fastflo.de/projects/emma</a> ) After installing the package I easily connected to the database with the info supplied by my web host and was then easily able to upload the database.</p>
<p align="justify">How to use EMMA is a bit beyond the scope of this article, but anyone familiar with databases, database structure or other database clients should easily be able to use EMMA. (Checkout the screenshot on the right or go to the fastflo website for a better idea of the interface) One feature I especially liked was that items shown in the query view (similar to phpMyAdmins 'browse') were shown in a table format that allowed direct editing of the values - no waiting for a browser to refresh!!</p>
<p align="justify">EMMA is based on "yamysqlfront" by the same author although it has been redesigned with extensibility in mind by utilising a plugin based architecture that allows contributors to provide additional features. Based on Python, EMMA is an open source project that is very easy to use and would easily be able to replace my need for phpMyAdmin for my day to day use.</p>
<div>With the site set up (it's based on DMCMS of course), all I now need to do is finalise the content and develop a new style template. You can view the progress at <a href="http://www.indau.com.au/" title="Indau Automation">http://www.indau.com.au</a></div>

	  <p>Well the new tax year here in Australia has brought change for in the guise of a new job. It's been a case of out with the old and in with the new as I have quit my old job and set up a company for industrial automation and software. For the past 3 or 4 years I have been working for an engineering company trying to set up an automation department for them, Unfortunately it's too much work for one person, and with little support and even less apparent interest from my employer I decided that I might as well put my effort into something that I would at least benefit from.<br /><br />At present I'm still setting things up, but look out for an announcement in the near future with further details. You can rest assured that there will be a website that uses the DMCMS code, and that there will be a bit of cross promotional marketing. If you're in need of software development or would like to employ an automation consultant - give me a shout.<br /><br />Another new development is that progress is being made on the 0.8.0 version and I have pretty much decided that the current 0.7.3 release should be released as a 'lite' version of the software. Generally I consider it to be stable, and whilst it may not be so pretty around the edges it deserves to live on rather than be simply discarded when the 0.8.0 version is released.<br /><br />The main differences between the two versions are that the 0.7.3 version has no user management outside of the appointment of additional admin users, whereas the 0.8.0 version has a full user permissioning and access rights system.<br /><br />I will take the time to tidy up the 0.7.3 admin interface to bring it into line with the 0.8.0 version and then schedule a release candidate for testing. <br /><br />Watch this space......<br /><br />DM.</p>

<p>June 17th is 'Download Day' - the official release date for Firefox 3. Firefox have decided to try and set a world record for the highest number of downloads in one day by publicising the release day for the new Firefox 3 as Download Day 2008. To take part all you have to do is download Firefox - Simple huh?</p>
<p>As a user of Ubuntu Hardy I've already been introduced to the relevent merits of Firefox 3 as the beta version comes bundled with the Ubuntu Hardy package. I've now been using it as my primary browser for the past month or so with no problems at all. The first thing I noticed about the new version of Firefox was that it appeared to run a lot faster than the older version - a definate plus for computer impatient people like myself - this is a real boom when using it for web developing - especially when constantly refreshing to check changes.</p>
<p>My one gripe with the beta version was that many of the addons that I use were not ported and were not compatible - not really a problem at all - this is something that will obviously change with the production version as addon authors update to be compatible with the new version.</p>
<p>So if you're already a user of Firefox 2 or want to upgrade your internet explorer to something a little better, why not update tomorrow and be a part of a new world record.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2008/05/06/ubuntu-804.html">Ubuntu 8.04</a></h2>
	  <p>Well not being able to resist the advert shown above, I decided to take the plunge and update my Ubuntu install. Generally I have been very happy with 'Gutsy' What could go wrong?</p>
<p align="justify">The update is very straightforward and is easily done via synaptics update manager - first you make sure that the current install is up to date and then it allows you to install the update. The whole process takes about 20 minutes whilst it downloads and installs the relevent files and then reboots.</p>
<p align="justify">There's&nbsp; a load of updated apps which is great as some of the apps in the Gutsy repository were a little out of date, Unfortunately there is still no VMware and more unfortunately it is likely that your curent VMware will stop working as mine did - however - fear not - it is fixable - After the mandatory google - I simply reinstalled it following some instructions for 8.04 and all was good (don't forget to back up your Virtual machine files first just in case).</p>
<p align="justify">One dissapointment for me was the new version of Firefox - well not firefox exactly (it's even better than it usually is) but the fact that most of the extension developers have not updated thier code to work with the new version. This is a bit of a pain for me as I regularly use quite a few additional tools for web development. The biggest pain is google sync as I use it to sync my bookmarks between my machines. Firebug and FireFTP need to come to the party too.</p>
<p align="justify">Maybe this is an apt time to get rid of FireFTP - after all there's integrated FTP support within Nautilus&nbsp; but Firebug is just too usefull a tool to do without - c'mon guys hurry it up or I will have to roll back to FF2.</p>
<p align="justify">As usual with Ubuntu - things simply work - there was nothing else I needed to 'fix' the update was completely painless - I'm sure that if VMWare was supported it too would have been painlessly and faultlessly updated.</p>
<p align="justify">So...</p>
<p align="justify">Go ahead, what are you waiting for?</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2008/04/09/a-good-time-to-try-linux.html">A Good Time To Try Linux</a></h2>
	  <p>With the New release of Ubuntu just around the corner and the bloated and expensive Vista requiring a hardware upgrade for most current 2000 / XP users to even be able to install it on thier machines it has never been a better time to try Linux. With the ability to be able to boot off of the disc and try Ubuntu without even having to install anything on your hard drive there is really no excuse - especially as it is free!</p>
<p><strong>5 months and still smiling</strong><br /><br />It has now been about 5 months that I've been solely using Ubuntu Linux as both my work and 'play' operating systems which means it's being used about 10-12 hours a day. So far I have only had to revert to using Windoze on one or two occasions - and that was only to use an excel file that I had written a bunch of VB code for as open office does not seem to support it. Eventually I will get around to re-writing the file in Javascript as a standalone software package - then my ties with Windoze will be completely gone.<br /><br />For emergency use I had set up Windows XP as a virtual machine (as well as leaving the Vista installation as dual boot when I initially installed Linux) The vitual machine allowed me to use the Excel file for a client demo, and as the virtual machine integrates quite nicely within the Linux window handling I'll leave it installed (see THIS video I recorded whilst writing this article). The dual boot Vista on the other had has not been booted into since I installed Linux on the machine - when I get some spare time I'll look into removing it.<br /><br />Another item of note is that I have managed to function using Linux in a solely windows envoironment - everyone else (with the exception of one Mac user) uses Windows at work, the main server is running Windows SBS, most of our clients use Windows. Even considering that I am probably the only person using Linux file sharing and editing of shared files has not caused any problems - Email from the SBS 2003 server has not been a problem - even acessing and creating public exchange folders is possible. <br /><br />Despite all the success, there are a few things to look out for - occasionally Evolution (the mail client I use) goofs out, Incorrect formatting within office documents seems to get very exaggerated within open office and you will probably need to manually set up some things that you take for granted on windows (such as being able to connect to the internet via bluetooth on my WM6 Smartphone) - Mind you, one point of note is that Ubuntu is a LOT more stable - as well as simply working with my Asus laptop from day 1, it has never suffered one lock up - I cannot say the same for my experience with any windows operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So,why not replace your MCE machine with Linux too?</strong></p>
<p>Being a long time user of a PC as a Media Controller I was pleasantly surprised to stumble across the <a href="http://www.linuxmce.org/" target="_blank">Linux MCE</a> project the other day, I had initially looked into using Linux as the operating system for a Media Centre type machine but had not really found anything that compared that worked 'out of the box' to the Windows MCE solution. However it would seem that things have progressed considerably in the past 3 years and the alternatives to MCE are slowly overtaking it.</p>
<p>My experience of using a PC as a media controller started way back in about 1998, After finally succumbing to accepting CD as a replacement for Vinyl, I had slowly replaced most of my&nbsp; collection. I then copied all of my CD's onto the PC as MP3 files and hooked up the output from the soundcard into my mixer, using Media Player I was able to listen to any album I wanted and putting it on shuffle I was never without music to listen to. Not having a TV, at that time I also installed a TV card - this allowed me to play my games console on the PC monitor and also hook up the Cable TV (which also provided my internet connection). This was a great setup that only really lacked a remote control - but with my wireless keyboard and moue on the coffee table it was a useable system.</p>
<p>That's how things remained until one day, about 3 / 4 years ago, after surfing the web I came across MCE - with it's remote control. 'Gotta have one of those' I thought - so I duly downloaded a 'trial' version of MCE and ordered myself a remote control from the internet - this made my Media PC 110% more useable but didn't work with my old TV tuner card - so I invested in a tuner card - along with a projector and my first Windows MCE machine was born.</p>
<p>After many months of happy use, I became interested in the whole Home Automation thing. To me it seemed like a logical progression - and probably spurred on by some article somewhere on the web I was determined to see if I cound integrate it into my PC. Unfortunately, It was about this time that my MCE trial 'Expired' and faced with the cost of having to replace my trial copy of MCE I started to look into alternatives. Linux MCE wasn't available back then, and whilst there were a number of Linux alternatives for both media control and home automation, none were really up to the same standard as MCE itself.</p>
<p>Having chosen X10 as a suitably cost effective way to automate my house I stumbled across <a href="http://www.embeddedautomation.com/" target="_blank">mControl</a> and thier seamless MCE integration (not to mention the remote access capabilities) - so my mind was made and I coughed up the price for the Win MCE software and invested in the mControl package.</p>
<p>This is basically how my system operates to this day except that the home automation is now controlled by a second 'permanently on' PC which is connected to a small touchscreen in the hallway (using the projector as the master screen is simply unpractical). The MCE PC has now been upgraded and sits in a nice Origen case and I often think of what direction the system should go next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So what next?<br /></strong></p>
<p>Many nights of pondering of what to do next on my home automation / media PC have led me to the conclusion that the next step is to extend the system into other areas of the house. We are currently renovating and will hopefully be extending the house soon and so I've considered what mods need to be done to the system to accomodate the new changes. The new extension will be the main living area and so will be the main media room, the outside entertaining area will also need to be connected into the media system, the new master bedroom could also benefit from a media terminal / tv, And eventually access control will be needed for visitors as we intend to put electric gates at the end of our driveway.</p>
<p>The home automation side of stuff is easy - I just install thin clients and touch screens that talk to the main Home automation PC - one for the front door - one for the outside entertaining area and one for the main living area. now all I need to do is to integrate the media into the same touchscreens - this is where the problems start!!!!</p>
<p>To extend the media experience into other areas with MCE I need to invest in 'Media Extenders', but at last look these were not available here in Australia, Ideally what I need is simply the software from a media extender so that I can install it into the thin clients - but unfortunately there's no software available and no API info from which to develop any. (typical Micro$oft).</p>
<p>So that unfortunately leaves MCE as not suitable as a complete home automation solution (a shame as the mControl integration is awesome)<br /><br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Enter Linux MCE</strong></p>
<p>Linux MCE is a definate contender against MCE - based on a branch of <a href="http://plutohome.com/" target="_blank">Pluto</a> - a proprietary distributed media system -&nbsp; the interface itself is built around completely different principles, the menus are integrated into the display rather than the display having to change to show a dominating menu system - this way the TV / Video is always present and always full screen. (no more annoying your partner by minimising the TV to a small box when you want to turn on the porch light) Navigation is also easier - especially with the dedicated gyro mouse, but best of all the thing that sets Linux MCE above Windows MCE is its multi room capability - not only can different media streams be used in different rooms the media can also be set to follow you as you move through the house.</p>
<p>Support is included for a number of home automation systems as well as integration for cameras. Linux MCE also features a fully loaded telephone system with the ability for call forwarding and answerphone services to name a few. In fact there's so much packed into it probably the best way to get to know it is to watch one of the many videos made on it.</p>
<p>For a full demo of how to install and use Linuc MCE check out the following video <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2176025602905109829" target="_blank">Linux MCE installation and useage Video</a> it's about 20-25 minutes long but worth it.</p>
<p>for a quicker explaination of some of the functions take a look at the flash presentation on the <a href="http://plutohome.com/" target="_blank">Pluto</a> site - it's basically the same.</p>
<p>There are also proprietary systems being supplied with Linux MCE installed - Fiire - <a href="http://www.fiire.com/" target="_blank">http://www.fiire.com/</a> offer three very reasonably priced products - a Linuc MCE server (basic system) called Fiire Engine, a Linuc MCE thin client called Fiire Station and the gyro remote called Fiire Chief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>But best of all... </strong></p>
<p>Not only is the Linux MCE project free, it's also open source.</p>
<p>I'm currently downloading the Linux MCE package and will let you know how I get on, if it proves to be a good as it first appears I'm sure that my Win MCE machine will soon become a Linux MCE machine.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2008/03/26/eclipse-pdt-and-xdebug-better-than-ultraedit.html">Eclipse PDT And Xdebug (Better Than Ultraedit?)</a></h2>
	  <p>Unusually I have found myself with a spare half hour this morning so decided to put it to good use and write a post here. Progress has been slow of late - the only thing that has really changed is the folder layout - I've created a few new folders and moved some files from the site root - the only real use this serves is simply to tidy things up a little. There's basically two new folders - 'javascript' and 'core_files' - both of these should be self explainatary. For those of you who are interested - checkout the latest CVS - you will see a branch called 'new_folder_layout' under the dmcms_080 module - that's the new site layout.<br /><br />Other worthy things of note are my continued useage of eclipse - some of you may recall that late last year I switched to Linux from Windoze (Ubuntu to be exact) the transition was relatively painless but it did leave me without a linux version of my trusty Ultraedit. Rumors of a Linux port aside it looked like UEdit Studio was not going to find its way over to the dark side and so that left me with little choice than to try something else - that something else was Eclipse with the PDT plugin (which I have installed by using the Pulse Eclipse manager).<br /><br />For the odd file edits here and there I must admit I use the built in text editor (Gedit) which has syntax highlighting and generally suits me fine but for project based stuff (like DMCMS) I've been using Eclipse. <br /><br />The integrated CVS client is great - there's not even any need for a key - just put in your password once and the checkout / update process is seamless and uninterrupted. Checking out into a project is very easy - in fact a project can be created when you check the files out if you require. Overall - very easy to use. My only (very small) complaint is that the CVS commands are hidden under a second level in the context menu (Under the 'Team' menu to be precise).<br /><br />With an active project you might want to set up the Xdebug integrated (free) php debugger - to do so you will need to select Xdebug as the default debugger from the properties menu (accessible under windows &gt; properties) and add in the path to your php executable. A point worthy of note here is that you may not have a php executable if you installed PHP from the repository - you might need to add the command line interface version of PHP - you can easily do this by the following command-(for ubuntu)<br /><br /><strong>sudo apt-get install php5-cli <br /></strong></p>
<p>Obviously replace the php5 with your version - now you should be able to find php5 under Usr/Bin (type 'find php5' in a terminal to list all occurances of php5).</p>
<p>The Xdebug debugger http://xdebug.org/ is an open source project that is now bundled into Eclipse, it is free and thus very obviously a fraction of the price of the Zend version. For those of you who have a license for the Zend product - Eclipse also offers support for this too</p>
<p>With the Xdebug debugger installed and the CVS client up and running I now have a tool of comparible use to Ultraedit Studio for PHP work -for me it's still a bit clunky but then that's probably more to do with the fact that I've been using ultraedit for many years - I'm sure I'l eventually get used to it.</p>
<p>So if you're looking for an alternative to Ultraedit or Ultraedit studio on your Linux / Ubuntu box it is definately worth giving Eclipse with the PDT plugin and the Xdebug debugger a go.</p>

	  <p>With the recent update of a site I help manage and some discussions about a new direction for DMCMS towards the social networking side of town I stumbled across a mod for phpBB that allows users to create thier very own blog. The mod, known as 'The Blog Mod' seems to have a very chequered history and is difficult to find somewhere that currently supports it. <br /><br />Trawling through the phpBB mods forums I found out that the original author (Hyperion) seemed to simply dissappear, A deluge of posting then raised the concern that the mod would simply die without some kind of rescue attempt - so another topic was started to discuss the relevent merits of saving the mod. The outcome of that discussion was that yet another topic was started to support the newly ressurrected 'Blog Mod' - after the topic was blasted for not being in the specific phpBB mod style, and the original auther gracefully backed out of thier offer of support yet another thread was started and the mod lived on...<br /><br />That was until about February when the official development thread on phpBB was locked. In addition the official website at <span class="postbody"><a href="http://www.theblogmod.com/" target="_blank">http://www.theblogmod.com</a> seems to have died about August time last year.<br /><br />It seems a shame that there is so much beurocracy over at phpBB that what appears to have been quite a well respected mod has now had the plug pulled on it by the closure of the thread, as for what happened to the official site, who knows?<br /><br />A little digging has found a few links to sites still hosting 'The Blog Mod' - <br /><a href="http://forum.khurram.ca/viewtopic.php?p=1248" target="_blank"><br />http://forum.khurram.ca/viewtopic.php?p=1248</a> </span></p>

	  <p>Regular visitors will have noticed that the site has been out of action for a number of weeks now - this is due to my web hosting providers poor service. I have been plagued by bad service from this provider since I started hosting with them last year - access to the email server would stop, as would access to the site, then it would start, then stop again... this seemed to be hourly.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /> No amount of service calls seemed to bring about a resolution - the tech team's standard response seems to be clear your browsers cookies and then restart your browser... mmmmmnnn... ok? <br /><br /> Well, a recent security breach left me pretty pissed - my site was hacked, filled with phishing software and then used as a launchpad for a spam assault - it would appear that the security breach was server wide - no doubt someone gaining access as root. I lost my site when they deleted it - with no warning and then had all my service requests ignored. All I can say is it is a good job that this site is not for profit - if I relied on it for an income I would be bankrupt by now. <br /><br /> Well enough was enough - I've now changed providers - hopefully the service should be a lot better. <br /><br /> Mind you, I had the last laugh yesterday when MD Webhosting's site was down again - they're probably still getting hacked. <br /><br /> My advice to anyone thinking of using MD Webhosting - DONT! They're not the cheapest and they're far from the best. <br /><br /> Anyhows - that's enough ranting from me - Just thought I'd add to the plethora of Google results that say MD Webhosting suck - guess I should have read a bit deeper before deciding to go with them. <br /><br /> Please be patient whilst I get the site back up and running, hopefully it shouldn't take too long. I'm limited for time at the moment so you may have to wait a while before I get the forum and Wiki back up. <br /><br /> DM.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2008/01/24/one-week-later.html">One Week Later...</a></h2>
	  <p>I've now been using Eclipse for the past 5 days and must admit I think I've found a serious contender for replacing Ultraedit. I've set up the CVS client plugin - which incidentally doesn't have the annoying problem found with crossvc and tortoise that requires you to input your password multiple times (I added it once and haven't needed to add it in again!!!) - the CVS client is as good as any others I've used - it integrates nicely into the main editor so you only really need to go into the plugin to set it up. Some of the terminology differs from what you might expect (instead of 'CVS' on the context menu it says 'team') but once you're used to it it really isn't a problem.</p>
<p><br />Eclipse as an editor has some nice productivity features - for instance - it searches all the code in the project and lists all instances of the text 'TODO' (and some other tags) and provides you with a task list in a window at the bottom the screen - these tasks link directly with the code in which they were found - clicking on them open the relevent file at the appropriate place. You can update / expand the text to make it more useable or readable, plus you can set priorities and mark them as finished too. What a great tool!!<br /><br />Code checking was one feature that I loved about using Ultraedit for writing PHP, well Eclipse not only includes code checking - it handles it in a very different way. Along side the task window you will find the 'Problems' window - this is a live list of all errors and warnings found in all files in the project - No need to syntax check each file - simple browse through the window content - again clicking on the error will take you directly to the relevent part of the code. Warnings and errors are also highlighted by a warning or error icon in the margin of the codepage.<br /><br />Another nifty feature that I love is the full page editing - if you double click on the tab for the page you want to edit all of the docked menus are automatically hidden and the page is shown full size within the editor - menus can still be accessed by the use of small icons around the edge of the screen. Double clicking the tab or selecting one of the restore icons returns the layout back to normal. This feature also works with any of the tabbed docked tool windows as well.<br /><br />I must admit however, I haven't found a column edit mode, which I use quite a lot in Ultraedit. <br /><br />In summary - I actually like this editor quite a lot, whether it is extensible enough to use for other non supported languages remains to be seen but as a PHP editing envoiroment it certainly cuts the mustard, I'm quite happy to adopt this as my primary PHP editor within the Linux envoironment.<br /><br />One thing of note is the way in which you choose to install it. I am running Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy) and found that if you wanted to install Eclipse via synaptics and then installl the plugin using the built in feature manager in Eclipse the PDT plugin will not install - this is because the version of Eclipse in the Gutsy repository is too old. this means that you can either manually install a later version of Eclipse, or install the PDT 'all in one'. <br /><br />There is also another alternative - you can use Eclipse 'Pulse' - this is an online plugin management service - it is free to use and currently in beta - Pulse provides PDT as a package as well.<br /><br />Anyhows...<br /><br />Enough talking for the moment - I actually have work to be getting on with. Currently I am working on getting the user group functionality sorted out for DMCMS - this will provide the possibility of many additional features - one of which will be user comments. (Hopefully some of you who read this might also contribute to the discussion) I just thoght I'd take the time to share my findings with Eclipse.<br /><br />L8RS<br /><br />DM.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2008/01/20/eclipse.html"> Eclipse</a></h2>
	  <p>Last Friday I decided to throw a curve ball at my editing practices and  try something that didn't involve Ultraedit. Somehow I ended up on the  Eclipse IRC network and had a chat about the relevent merits of Eclipse,  it's useability, scalability etc. I had briefly tried Eclipse before  but had not really tried to use it in earnest, plus I think that I  probably had the wrong version installed. <br /><br />Eclipse is basically  an editor platform on which plugins are added to flavour it to your  requirements - if you want to edit and compile C++ you simply install  the relevent plugins to turn it into a C++ IDE. Likewise for PHP / Web  editing you add in the relevent PHP plugins - this is the part I didn't  do last time! Armed with new information - and a link to the PDT package  download page (the PDT package is the PHP Development Tools plugin) I  installed a copy of Eclipse. It's worth noting at this point that if you  don't have the Java Runtime installed on your machine you will need to  install it as the program will not function correctly - the installer  will alert you if you need to install it (you can install it easily via  synaptics).<br /><br />My first impressions of the PDT package are that it  seems to be pretty impressive - I like the way that it lists included  files in a hand to use menu, the syntax highlighting is as good as most -  generally the layout is well presented. Projects are easily generated  and it has a built in CVS client although I havent set it up yet.<br /><br />I'm  going to try using it for the next week or so and see how I get on.

	  <h2><a href="/general/2008/01/15/cvs-linux-or-windows.html">CVS Linux Or Windows???</a></h2>
	  <p>With my new Ubuntu installation taking shape there are only a few  things left to sort out to make it 100% functional as my primary web  developing machine. So far I have not regretted making the change,  especially as I can now run my beloved Ultraedit Studio within VMware on  a virtual XP machine. The transition has been pretty seamless, the  interface is intuitive and a pleasure to use. I have made a few minor  customisations to help increase productivity and changed the theme to  add a little eye candy.</p>
<p>The main change was  adding in the Compiz manager so that I could enable a few additional  desktop effects - specifically I added a 'hot corner' to the 'Scale'  effect so that I could use it as an entourage type screen switcher -  this also works great with VMware. Normally you need to press the 'ctrl'  + 'alt' key combo to release the mouse focus from the VM - setting a  hot corner to the top right of the screen means that the Scale effect is  called regardless - no need to press the key combo - simply moving the  mouse to the top right not only releases the mouse focus but also calls  the scale effect. Checkout the screenshot on the left - The VMware  screen integrates seamlessly with the rest of the applications. For the  best effect you should turn off the tabs, toolbar and summary so that  the VM looks like any other Application window. Click on the image to  open up a larger version.</p>
<p>Using VMware this way has allowed  me to retain the use of Ultraedit (which is good as  bought a lifetime  subscription - lol), but it does leave me with another small dilema -  what cvs program do I use?????</p>
<p>Up until now I have used Tortoise  CVS - an excellent program that integrated nicely into the windows  shell. For a while I also used the CVS built into Ultraedit but found  Tortoise to be far superior.</p>
<p>OK - No probs - I'll just carry on  using tortoise...... NOPE.......  only problem is that whilst the  Virtual Machine can write to the shared folder via the Samba server (see  <a href="../../index.php?page=home&amp;id=34">previous  article</a> for file sharing between Ubuntu and a windows Virtual  Machine) it does not seem to be able to use it for checking out CVS  projects, this is a bit of a problem for me as I always check out the  project files directly to my webserver root - I don't really want to  check them out and then have to move move them - thats far too much  work. The real solution is to find a suitable Linux CVS client. I guess  my prerequisites are that it needs to have some kind of graphical  interface or 'GUI' to be correct. I can't be bothered learning command  line interactions for updating / commiting / adding files via the  command line CVS client - and it needs to be compatible with the  Sourceforge repository.</p>
<p>A little Google later and I have installed  Crossvc (it's in the Ubuntu repository simply install it from  Synaptics. Without reading up I quickly added a profile with the server  info for the dmcms repository at Sourceforge. I then selected checkout  from the project menu - after selecting the destination folder, browsing  to the module I wanted to checkout and selecting a name for the folder I  had checked out the latest version of DMCMS and had it automatically  added to the Crossvc 'Workbench'. I had to manually type my password a  couple of times - but it worked like a dream - the interface readily  displays the current status of your project and also provides some nice  features like file compare and version history.</p>
<p>At the moment I  am trying to work out how to use my SSH key so that I only have to type  my password in once - When I've figured it out I will update this  post....</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2008/01/12/lamp-not-wamp.html">Lamp Not Wamp</a></h2>
	  <p>As regular readers would know, I have recently changed my primary  operating system over to Ubuntu. This computer is mostly used for web  development so running a Linux based system makes sense as the end  platorm I write for is Linux based.<br /><br />On Windows I usually use <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/">WampServer</a> to host and test PHP  code on my local machine, this is basically an AMP stack (Apache2 + PHP5  + MySQL) bundled with phpMyAdmin and a nice task bar 'applet'  where  you can change settings, start / stop the server etc.. All of this is  installed from a sinle installer file - things don't get much more  convenient than that.<br /><br />To make my Ubuntu (Desktop version)  installation more useable I needed to install the LAMP stack but this  involved installing the components seperately. This isn't really that  hard but it does require using the terminal and typing some commands in.  Incidently, you can use Ubuntu server version which already has this  set up, but being aimed at use as a server it is void of other programs.<br /><br />Installation  of the AMP stack is best carried out in order - this is basically  Apache &gt; PHP &gt; SQL.<br /><br />To install Apache2 you will need to use  the following command - <br /><br />sudo apt-get install apache2<br /><br />You  may get an error as follows - "<em>apache2: Could not determine the  server’s fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.0.1" </em>this is  easily remedied by adding the following line to your httpd.conf file</p>
<p>ServerName  localhost</p>
<p>You can call the file up in the text editor by using  the following command</p>
<p>gksudo gedit /etc/apache2/httpd.conf</p>
<p>Now  you can install php5 and MySQL by using the following command</p>
<p>sudo  apt-get install mysql-server libapache2-mod-auth-mysql php5-mysql</p>
<p>That's  it - You now have a working test server, you should be able to view the  Apache test page by typing <a href="http://localhost/" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outbound/article/localhost');">http://localhost</a> or <a href="http://127.0.0.1/" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker  ('/outbound/article/127.0.0.1');">http://127.0.0.1</a> in to your  browser. The server root is located at ./var/www - just add your php  files and you are done.</p>
<p>If, like me you use phpMyAdmin to manage  your SQL databases you can easily install it by using the following  command</p>
<p>sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin</p>
<p>It will ask you  which Apache installation you want to install it for - make sure that  you select Apache2 by pressing the space bar before continuing and  pressing enter - if you forget to do this it will not install the  symbolic link allowing you to type http://localhost/phpmyadmin into your  browser to access it. It will also ask you to set a password for the  root account (a good idea).</p>
<p>Once installed you can access  phpMyAdmin by typing <a href="http://localhost/phpmyadmin" target="_blank">http://localhost/phpmyadmin</a> into your browser.</p>
<p>Finally  - if, like me you use Ubuntu you might want to change the permissions  of the 'www' folder so that you have read / write access from within  your normal user account - to do this type 'gksudo nautilus' into a  terminal window - this will open up Nautilus as root allowing you to  change folder permissions to suit.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you want to  change the location of the webservers root to within your home folder  you can edit the virtual hosts file. you can do this by typing the  following comment into a terminal</p>
<p>sudo gedit  /etc/apache2/sites-available/default</p>
<p>This opens up the Virtual  hosts file for editing. Simply replace the current information pointing  to the /var/www/ folder with the path to a folder in your home directory  - ie /home/username/web/. By doing this typing http://locahost will  take you to the 'web' folder in your home directory. Dont forget to  restart the Apache service after making any changes by issuing the  following command</p>
<p>sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</p>
<p>With  an up and running webserver I can now move my development files across  and also add whatever databases I need. The only thing I can't do is  access any files from within XP in VMWare. This is easily rectified.</p>
<p>VMWare  Workstation comes with the ability to share folders between the host  and client, VMWare Server unfortunately does not. This is not a problem  as files can be shared by using the Samba filesharing server. There are a  number of different ways of doing this but the following way suited me  best.<br /><br />Install Samba by issuing the following command<br /><br />sudo  apt-get install samba smbfs<br /><br />Now edit the smb.conf file <br /><br />sudo  gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf<br /><br />Uncomment the following line <br /><br />security  = user<br /><br />and make sure that the workgroup name is set to the same  as the workgroup in your XP virtual machine. <br /><br />now add a password  for your user account by using the following command<br /><br />sudo  smbpasswd -a username<br /><br />(Obviously replacing username for your  username)<br /><br />Restart the Samba service by using the following  command<br /><br />sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart<br /><br />Ok. Now all you  need to do is share the folders that you want to access from within your  XP virtual machine.<br /><br />Open Nautilus as root<br /><br />gksudo nautilus<br /><br />Now  navigate to the folders you want to share and simply right click on  them. From the menu select 'Share Folder' and select 'share through  windows network snb'</p>
<p>(Note, if you want to share files / folders  from within your own home folder you do not need to open Nautilus as  root)</p>
<p>Now you can acces the files / folders by browsing to them via  network neighborhood or by using the address in the following format<br /><br />\\Computername\Foldername</p>
<p>Next  I need to install a CVS Client but more about that later...</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2008/01/10/dual-boot-linux-and-windows.html">Dual Boot Linux And Windows</a></h2>
	  <p>As some of you may recall, after a recent hard drive crash I invested  in a new laptop and then installed Ubuntu on the old laptop. This was a  great idea as I found that all of the previous issues I had encountered  whilst using Linux seem to have been addressed with Ubuntu (I have  previously used Fedora). The only problem I found was that I was  neglecting the new laptop and using the old machine with Ubuntu on it a  little tto much.<br /><br />With renewed enthusiasm in Lunux I would love to  make the jump from Windows but try as hard as I can - I cant seem to  take the plunge and replace Vista on the new laptop with Linux. This is  mostly due to not being to find a decent replacement for Ultraedit -  I've tried the alternatives - none of which really cut the mustard, I've  even installed Ultraedit running under WINE but nothing quite matches  up to my expectations (Ultraedit is just too sluggish running under wine  to be really useable for me)<br /><br />Well....<br /><br />Although I haven't  one the whole hog - I HAVE taken the plunge and set up the new laptop as  dual boot Linux / Vista.<br /><br />This is actually very easy to do with  Ubuntu Gutsy - basically you'll need to have Vista already installed and  then boot up with the Ubuntu CD. Once booted, click on the 'Install'  icon on the desktop and the installation process will start - it will  ask you a few questions and then launch into the partitioning tool. The  partitioning tool will present you with 3 options - assisted partition /  use whole disk / manual partition. Choose the first option (assisted  partition). The tool will then ask you what size you want to adjust the  partition to - choose a suitable size and then the installer will do the  rest.<br /><br />When the installation is finished it will ask you to  remove the disk from the drive and hit enter - the machine will then  reboot and start with a boot menu allowing you to select what os you  want - the bottom option will be windows.<br /><br />Anyhows.....<br /><br />With  Ubuntu installed on my machine I have opted to install VMware under  Linux so that I can run Windows as a Virtual Machine - this will allow  me to run Ultraedit and the other applications that I need that I can't  find Linux alternatives for (mostly work related applications such as  robot programming clients). Setting it up in this way I can use Ubuntu  as my primary ooperating system :)<br /><br />I have also taken the plunge  and done the same for my company laptop - evolution works flawlessly as  an exchange client and I seem to have less network problems with Ubuntu  than I did with Windows. (plus I can't wait to see the look on the IT  managers face - lol).<br /><br />The coming weeks will be a real test to see  if I can live without windows - it shouldn't be a problem with the  company laptop as I don't do any programming with that machine - just  manager stuff involving the office suite (open office that is ;) ) and  project based stuff for which I already use open workbench.<br /><br />If I  can happily live without booting into Vista on the other machine I will  remove it :D<br /><br />One annoyance has come out of this - my new laptop  came with a recovery disk - the disk is an Asus branded disk that will  only allow installation onto an Asus machine - This however means that  it won't allow me to install Vista into VMware as it  does not see the  virtual machine as an Asus machine - phah!!! - looks like I will have to  revert back to XP for the time being.<strong><br /><br /></strong></p>

<p><strong>DMCMS Latest</strong></p>
<p>With  renewed vigour I have been ploughing into getting the next release of  DMCMS ready. At the moment I've been working on groups and group  membership - I'm trying to set it up so that there can be any number of  groups and users can be members of multiple groups - this level of  flexibility when coupled with access permissions granted to group  members should make DMCMS very flexible in terms of managing content  access.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm thinking of access restrictions in terms  of categories -</p>
<p>Basically when you create a category you assign  access rights to one or more groups. - members of these groups will be  able to access any content within the category. Members of other groups  will not.</p>
<p>The same method is applied to the visbility of the  category within the navigation structure - for users who are not a  member of an assigned group the category will not be visible in the  navigation menu.</p>
<p>Eventually I will extend this to a per article  basis so that both categories and individual articles access  restrictions can be set independently.</p>
<p>Other changes include the  removal of forum integration - this will be re-written as a plugin and a  complete re-write of the style / layout dues to too many issues with  the current version.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2008/01/06/an-e-mail-server-for-your-wamp-setup.html">An E-Mail Server For Your WAMP Setup</a></h2>
	  <p>For all of my development work I use an AMP stack running on my  windows machine (commonly referred to as a WAMP server). This allows me  to run Apache / PHP / MySQL on my windows box without the need for a  Linux machine - very handy if you are developing something like DMCMS  and don't have a linux box on which  to test your work. Over the years I  have tried many different WAMP distro's -  I've even installed the  seperate components myself.</p>
<p>Nowdays I tend to favour Wampserver -  <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/" target="_blank">http://www.wampserver.com/</a> as it is compact, easy to install and has a nice, easy to use  interface. I have also used UniServer (<a href="http://www.uniformserver.com/" target="_blank">http://www.uniformserver.com/</a> )  as it has a very small footprint and can be installed on a memory  stick so it can be used an any PC. However, it didn't integrate  correctly with the syntax checking function in Ultraedit so for the time  being Wampserver is my tool of choice (although I must admin I have no  use for SqlLiteManager).</p>
<p>The only problem I found with Wampserver  is that it does not include a mail server - this makes it impossible to  test any mail functions within your software.</p>
<p>With my current  focus on getting DMCMS Version 080 ready, it didn't take long for me to  get bored with uploading changed files to a test site, so that I could  test out changes involving sending mail, so I decided to install a mail  server on my Windoze machine.</p>
<p>A little searching about lead me to <a href="http://center.uniformserver.com/mail_server/mail_server_1.html" target="_blank">this article</a> on the UniServer website.</p>
<p>The  article outlines the installation and setup of Office Mail. (available  from <a href="http://www.burrotech.com/om_download.php" target="_blank">http://www.burrotech.com/om_download.php</a> )</p>
<p>Office mail is a free to use program that runs a mail server /  service on your Windoze box, usefull for internal and external  corporate applications, it also seamlessly integrates with your Apache  installation allowing you to test any sendmail functionality you may  have within your code. There is a free version and a registered version -  for my purposes the free version is great - it adds a footer to the  bottom of outgoing emails which is customisable in the registered  version but then as it's only for testing I wasn't worried about the  footer.</p>
<p>Installation is straight-forward and once installed you  basically need to set the 'SMTP Delivery' so that 'outgoing mail is  returned to sender'. You can then add a user by clicking on the add user  button on the the 'Users' tab - You will need to associate an email  address with the user account by setting an alias under the 'Local  Distribution' tab. Once this is done you are all set to test.</p>
<p>You  may need to modify your php.ini file if the 'sendmail_from' directive is  commented out or not set as this will end up returning an error when  you try to send an email using your php script - dont forget to restart  your servce after doing this.</p>
<p>You can now test your mail script  using the php <a href="http://au2.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php" target="_blank">mail()</a> function - set the 'to' field to the alias  address of the user you previously added - make sure Office Mail is  running and then run your code - if all is good, you can then view the  mail in the office mail program by clicking on the user name in the  application.</p>
<p>For more detailed instructions view the article  above on the UniServer website - for UniServer users there is also a  further article on how to integrate Office mail into your portable  UniServer setup.</p>

	  <p>With the first working week of the year at an end I am very pleased  with myself - not only have I managed to release two DMCMS updates but I  have also managed to keep my other resolutions too. The long long  overdue security update was rolled out in Version 0.7.1 closely followed  by another version to address a couple of small issues that were missed  with the first release. Whilst only up for  few hours the Version 0.7.1  release had 20 downloads - thats a lot of interest in such a short  period of time - hopefully this is an indication of things to come.<br /><br />Work  has continued on the Version 0.8.0 release with a number of items being  crossed off of the To Do list. In a bid to keep visitors more informed I  have added a 'Current Task' to the To Do page to indicate what I'm  currently working on, I also split out the list into items scheduled for  the next release (To Do List) and items for later releases (Wish List) -  this has allowed me to review and remove a few items from the 0.8.0  release to speed up it's release. Hopefully this should provide an  accurate status for future project development.<br /><br /><strong>Have you  visited ohloh.net?</strong></p>
<p>Also worthy of mention is <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/" target="_blank">http://www.ohloh.net</a> -  Ohloh was started up in 2004 as a way of providing more visitbility into  software development. Utilising a number of aids ohloh provides  analytical data and project overviews in an easy to read format.  Statistics can be viewed for both projects and contributors alike. In  addition Kudos points can be awarded between members. Members can also  add projects to 'Stacks' (a personal colletions of projects) allowing  projects to be suggested to them based on common choices.</p>
<p>Naturally  I added DMCMS as a project. The project page proides entries for RSS  feeds, descriptions and after adding CVS information a breakdown of the  content of the project is displayed.</p>
<p>Amusingly the breakdown  indicates that it would cost you approximately $844,130 if you wanted to  hire a team to replicate DMCMS - And to think I gave it away for free -  surely THAT should give me some kudos points.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2007/12/28/resolutions.html">Resolutions</a></h2>
	  <p>Once again it is that time of year where most of us will make the  resolve to change something for the New Year. Usually this ends up with  failed attempts and frustrations with only some being lucky enough to  follow through.<br /><br />Well - it is coming up to one whole year since I  gave up smoking :) I guess this time round I was one of the lucky ones -  although I didn't give up on New Years Eve - it was more like mid  January. Maybe this is why I was successfull? Who knows? (If I did I  would have spent the past year marketing my 'how to give up smoking'  book).<br /><br />But now it's time for me to make some more promises to  myself - this year my biggest goal is to get a little fitter (I managed  to put a few pounds on in the process of giving up smoking), a hard task  for most - hopefully I can apply the same determination to this as I  did to giving up smoking last year (In a way I almost feel that now I've  managed to give up smoking I can achieve anything).<br /><br />A much  harder task to acheive will be getting DMCMS V0.8 into a state where it  is ready to release - this is however one of my New Years Resolutions.<br /><br />Looking  back over the past year a lot of progress was made on the development  of DMCMS in the first 6 months - the whole project was made public on  Sourceforge (there have been nearly 600 downloads to date from the  Sourceforge site), it has been targetted by various hackers exploiting  vulnerabilities in the code (which I see almost as an honour - lol), it  has been promoted on various websites and it has continued to provide  the basis for most of the websites that I create / manage. Unfortunately  the latter part of the year provided no further releases due to other  commitments.<br /><br />My commitment for 2008 is to get the Version 0.8  release finished so that it can be made public - The biggest part of the  V0.8 release is the user management features. The decision to integrate  user management into DMCMS was taken earlier in the year and it has  proven to be quite a bit more work than originally anticipated. The  current test releases have a functioning user management system that  provides user registration and user commenting for registered users. The  plan for the final V0.8 release is to also include a permissions system  so that access can be restricted to created pages.<br /><br />Currently the  permissions system allows users to be split into three different  categories - <br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Users (this category is for registered  users) </li>
<li>Administrators (these users have access to all site  features) </li>
<li>Moderators (these users can modify / delete / add  content).</li>
</ul>
<p><br />These user categories are mostly to deal with  the commenting system - moderators can be made to carry out moderation  functions but thier access to other admin functions is completely  restricted, Administrators obviously have access to do anything and  Users have to be logged in to be able to post (therefore they have to be  registered).<br /><br />No Guest posting is allowed as this will most  probably just event in a lot of unwanted spam. User registration  involves confirmation by email for account activation. I have also added  captcha integration using the reCaptcha API for added anti-spam  security - this may or may not be bindled with the release - I'm not  sure at the moment - I personally think it's great but I also have to  consider the added complexity it presents to the user setting up a DMCMS  installation.<br /><br />The [currently] limited user account types will  have to be expanded to provide access control to created pages, it is  most likely that this will be expanded to customizable user groups. This  route is almost a definate as it fits in well with another project that  I am currently undertaking where I need to provide a seperate area for  each logged in (subscribed) user - the ability to be able to create  unique groups will allow me to be able to assign a group to each user. I  can then create a page specifically for each user where access is only  granted for the group associated with the user. Fully customisable user  groups also allows the end user to choose a name for the groups that  best suit thier site.</p>
<p>This method of access restriction works  well, as a user can be made a member of many groups, meaning that access  can be infinately complex. I may also add a timed function so that  users can be made a member of a particular group from / until a specific  time, this is something that I will need to do for the other project I  am working on as paid subscriptions will be required, it seems logical  to also include the features develped for my other projects in DMCMS  too.</p>
<p>My other New Years Resolutions relate to other projects that  I need to finish - I currently have a web based project that is in the  initial stages of development, a desktop application that is 25% of the  way through, a WM5 application that needs rescuing (it was finished but  then a hard drive failure has meant that I lost some files) and an idea  for another web based project. All of these projects (with the exception  of the last one) need to be finished within the next few months,  fortunately the web based project largely depends on DMCMS V0.8 so it is  likely that this will cause the next DMCMS release to be pushed along  nicely.</p>
<p>Maybe then I will work on my new web idea - but more of  that later....</p>
<p>In the mean time - A Happy New Year to everyone,  and a big Big BIG thanks to everyone who has supported DMCMS over the  past year.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2007/12/27/wine-at-christmas.html">Wine At Christmas</a></h2>
	  <p>Regular readers would remember my look into IDE's / Programming  Editors for the Linux platform from the last post. My main reason for  this was to try and find something to replace Ultraedit Studio which has  been my weapon of choice for coding for the past 7 or 8 years. Well,  I've possibly found a better alternative - running Ultraedit 'natively'  on Linux!<br /><br />No, unfortunately IDM have not decided to port UE for  Linux (although more on that below...), I have discovered Wine. Wine is  an application layer that allows Windoze applications to run on Linux by  allowing access to dll files.<br /><br />The Wine website has an  application database that lists applications tested with Wine, this  ranges from applications like UEdit to PC based games. There are several  entries listed for Ultraedit - namely different versions. There are  some reports that ftp functionality does not work or is limited but  generally it appears that Ultraedit functions fine. The Database entry  can be viewed <a href="http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=7307" target="_blank">HERE</a> and the Wine Home page can be viewed HERE</p>
<p>Installation  of Wine in Ubuntu is easy - simply choose Wine in the Synaptic Package  Manager. Wine is also available for other flavours of linux, with  installation options to suit each.</p>
<p>After installing Wine, you will  now need to download a copy of Ultraedit to your linux box. I've chosen  to download and install Ultraedit Studio. Installation involves setting  the exe file to open with Wine - this can be easily done by right  clicking on the file and choosing 'open with other application'.</p>
<p>A  bit of a tip - I found that if I chose the custom installation it would  fall over trying to register wodCertificate.dll - wheras choosing the  typical installation had no problems.</p>
<p>After the Installation  process has been run you should now have a working copy of Ultraedit.</p>
<p>If  you don't like the appearance you can install theme files but general  reports of these are that they do have an effect an performance. THIS  thread over at 'Linux for Designers' shows how you can modify the  registry settings within Wine to change it's appearance to something a  little easier on the eyes.</p>
<p>Whilst on the topic of Linux for  Designers - I noticed a link there to <a href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page" target="_blank">IEs 4 Linux</a> a packaged installation allowing  Internet Explorer 5, 6 and 7 to be run under Wine in Linux (and also  OSX). Testing under IE 6 and 7 is a must for web developers (and some  would argue testing under IE5 is also a necessity), Under windows XP I  used to use IEolas to run IE6 alongside IE7 for testing, but this  stopped working with the introduction of Vista.</p>
<p>The IEs 4 Linux  package is easily installed by following the instructions <a href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Installation" target="_blank">HERE</a> - Internet Explorer 5 and 6 can be installed by  checking the checkboxes on the installer dialog that appears - if you  want to install IE7 you will also need to click the advanced button and  select the checkbox there as well.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2007/12/19/linux-programming-editors.html">Linux Programming Editors</a></h2>
	  <p>A week or so in and I am really digging my Ubuntu installation, so much so that I'm almost regretting spending the cash on the new laptop - Installing Ubuntu on my old Dell Latitude has speeded it up end - it's now a much more useable machine. So far I have only had one issue with the Ubuntu installation - I've not yet been able to get WEP authentication working on wireless - the wireless card connects to non-secured networks no problem - but doesn't connect to WEP secured networks. Anyways - it's not a major issue and I'm sure I will sort it out in time.</p>
<p>EDIT: I reconfigured my router to use WEP Open Authentication and now it works!</p>
<p>I've decided to transfer over my web development onto the Ubuntu machine - I figure that if I can manage to comfortably use ubuntu to write code then I will junk my copy of Windoze Vista on the new laptop and make the jump over to linux permanent. The few programs that I need to run in windows can be run inside of VXWorks.<br /><br />My biggest issue is finding a replacement of Ultraedit - I've been using Ultraedit (Studio) for about the past 7 years and have found it hard to move away from using it, it simply has too many usefull features that many other editors do not. In the past I have tried many different open source editors for the Windoze platform but none quite hit the mark (I use Notepad++ on my work machine as they are too tight to cough up for a copy of Ultraedit). Linux appears to be no different.<br /><br />The main 'advanced' features I use for editing are syntax highlighting, function lists, bracket matching, project management, cvs integration, column editing, find / replace in files and php syntax checking.</p>
<p>I mainly use Uedit Studio for my web development - PHP / HTML / CSS, however it does get used for more specialist programming endeavours such as robot programming and so things like compiler integration is very handy.</p>
<p>After quite a bit of searching about I've singled out two packages to test drive - Bluefish and KDevelop. I've excluded other 'obvious' choices such as VIM and Emacs as they appear to bear little resemblance to the Uedit interface, this was important for me as I would like the transition to be as smooth as possible. I've also exluded programs such as Eclipse and Netbeans as they are predominantly Java IDE's. (More on those in a later article)</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that Bluefish is a straight forward text editor whilst KDevlop is an IDE - this means that there are a whole bunch of features that KDevelop will posess that a straight forward editor will not. In effect it is the same as comparing Uedit with Uedit Studio</p>
<p><a href="http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/" target="_blank">http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.kdevelop.org/" target="_blank">http://www.kdevelop.org/</a> <br /><br />Bluefish was very easy to install under Ubuntu (Gutsy) - simply type 'apt-get install bluefish' into a terminal window and the rest is taken care of for you (It doesn't get much easier than that!!).</p>
<p>(Note! - you can also install applications using the Add/Remove link under the Applications menu or the Synaptic Package Manager under the System &gt; Administration menu)</p>
<p>First impressions are that it looks to be a very capable program, The first thing that jumps out at me is the custom menu, with it's array of tags and text snippets - very usefull. It also includes project management. Unfortunately it does not have a column mode for text selection but does have syntax highlighting (although it needs to be manually turned on when creating a file). Another missing component for me is 'find in files' - an invaluable tool when updating code changes across a whole project.<br /><br />KDevelop is just as easy to install - Just type 'apt-get install kdevelop' into a terminal window as before. It takes a little longer to install but then it is a bigger app. After installation you will see a number of applications appear under the 'programming' tab in the Applications menu. The application I'm interested in is the 'scripting' application.<br /><br />First impressions are not really that impressionable, but dig a little deeper - look inside a few menus and the usefullness of this program is soon apparent. Whilst testing the applications I created a small 'hello world' php file, the syntax highlighting automatically detected what type of file I had created - very impressive. There is a column mode (although they refer to it as block selection), find in files, even pre included php documentation.</p>
<p>My conclusions are that KDevelop is a very good replacement for UEStudio, it includes most of the advanced features required for my useage and possibly even external compiler integration (I've yet to look into setting this up but it appears to be supported) For any UEStudio users swapping to Linux from the Windows platform I reccomend KDevelop as a worthy editor.</p>
<p>If your requirements are less advanced, I would reccomend Bluefish as a more than capable editor. It is intuitive to use and comes bundled with a plethora of usefull tools for web code authoring.</p>
<p>For the time being I will keep both apps installed and test them further - I will give you an update in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>As my search for suitable applications for my new Linux machine continues, one of the coming articles will hopefully be an impression of other available development envioronments such as NetBeans and Eclipse. I have always predominantly devloped in Visual Basic, with a little work within C++ but have been meaning to investigate Java as it is cross platform compatible. With the excercise of trying to replace Windoze with Linux I now need to find a suitable alternative to VB as I have a new project looming in the near future.</p>

	  <p>A recent hard drive crash ended up in me treating myself to a new laptop. Somehow the hard drive on my old Dell decided to just... well... stop working. A bit strange to say the least - the hard drive was less than a year old and hadn't really seen any rough use. But anyhows - I used the whole fiasco to talk myself into replacing the whole laptop with a new one (but of course bought a replacement H/D to revive the Dell)<br /><br />With my new machine pretty much installed and up and running, with the exception of a webserver to my taste (I've been playing with Ulimate Server - a slim php/sql distro that runs from a USB stick but it doesn't work with my syntax checker) I decided to get the Dell up and running with linux.<br /><br />After looking into the current range of Linux distro's I decided to give Ubuntu a go as it seemed like the least painfull route to getting it up and running. I have previously used Fedora but had a lot of trouble with wireless drivers.<br /><br />So far I must say that I am very impressed with ubuntu and the ease of installation. (I'm typing this from Firefox in ubuntu right now ;) ). everything has worked pretty much right out of the box. I've enabled Beryl (the expose style task switcher) and am currently setting up the avant window manager (a mac icon dock clone).<br /><br />Other software will get installed in time - I'm already happy using open office and gimp the only program I need to sort out is a decent text editor...<br /><br />I'll keep you posted of the progress.</p>

	  <p>Regular visitors to the site will notice the sudden shift in editorial  content on the front page. This used to be the space where info and  download links for my open source CMS project was displayed, that is  until now...<br /><br />I originally registered the site for the CMS and  have used it as both a testbed for new CMS code and as a platform from  which it is aupported and served. The change in focus is largely due to  other developments now taking a larger protion of my time away from the  CMS, and a descision to free up the DeeEmm name association from being  solely associated with the CMS.<br /><br />The name DeeEmm is the phonetic  spelling for DM, which is in turn an acronym for an old nickname of  mine. I used to use the name (and still do of course) as a psuedonym  under which I program. Nowdays my identity is much less of a secret than  it was way back when I first assumed the DeeEmm nickname but old habits  die hard.<br /><br />Hopefully this page will develop into my personal blog  and include news about tech stuff that I'm working on. (Yup - I know -  just what the world needs is another blog) In a sense it is also a  massive advertisement for myself to the rest of the world and can  potentially be used as a platform from which to offer my services - for  that reason alone it needs to be at least jazzed up a little as it is  just a little dull :)<br /><br />Work on the CMS is still continuing, the  bugfix for the SQL injection vulnerability has been implimented in a  number of test sites and will be rolled out soon. Version 8 is still on  the horizon, there are still a number of items to fix up but it is  basically operational. I have a live version 8 site up and running at  the moment and all appears to be well. The site was successfully updated  from version 7 using the update function and will be used to test out  the remaining bux fixes and features before the next release.<br /><br />My  main focus with the CMS at the moment is to get the user management  system completely up and running - at present it is functional but  wholely untested. The addition of the user management system was a  decision made some time back, it has meant that the final release has  been delayed quite considerably but it has also proven to be a sound  decision due to the demand from a number of current projects to have  user management functionality.<br /><br />One such project requires a  subscription based access restriction system to be employed - hence my  current focus on getting stuff to a point where it is functional. The  same project also requires ecommerce functionality, but I doubt that  this will make it's way into the open source release.<br /><br />Anyways....<br /><br />This  is more than enough rambling from me, I have real work to do -  specifically getting the commenting system tested - that way some of you  folks reading this can comment.<br /><br />DM.</p>

	  <p>A recent hard drive failure has forced me to purchase myself a long  overdue new laptop. I ended up purchasing a nice Asus F3. The machine is  a lot better than my old Dell 505 which has served me well for the past  four years but unfortunately came installed with vista. A long time  user of Dell products, I decided on the F3 as it has a very similar feel  to the 505, which after struggling with my Toshiba Tecra at work was  very important to me (the tecra has a number of really annoying features  / non-features such as no right hand control button, windows button at  top of keyboard, lack of bluetooth etc etc...)<br /><br />The spec of the  machine is much better than my dell and should see me ok for the next  few years.<br /><br />Originally I had considered changing to macs but the  extortionate price of the macbook pro gave me trouble justifying it. My  next choice was very obviously Dell, but as I really needed to pick  something up this weekend I was left with little choice than to change  manufacturer.<br /><br />Being a writer of open source code I decided that  it was also long overdue to replace my aging office suite with a better  and open source version - especially as I dont think my old version is  compatible with vista.<br /><br />I've tried open office before - it came  bundled with a fedora installation that I installed and I also installed  / uninstalled it from my old laptop. this time though - I've decided  that I will not give in to the pressure of installing office instead.<br /><br />Browsing  duties go exclusively to Firefox of course, but with the addition of  Internet Exploder / Opera and now Safari  for testing purposes.  Unfortunately the ieolas standalone version of IE6 no longer works :(<br /><br />(deja  vu)<br /><br />Another product that I've downloaded is netbeans - an open  source and cross platform IDE supporting multiple languages. I've yet to  use it and so cannot tell if it can replace visual studio express for  me - I will keep you all posted.<br /><br />I previously used sharpsoft but  ended up replacing it with visual studio express as it was a little too  buggy.<br /><br /><br />I'm embarking on a project to develop a desktop app -  its a basic data handling and reporting app - I'm tempted to use the  java portion of netbeans to write this - both as a test of the IDE and  also to end up with a x-platform app.<br /><br /><br />Another change for me  is the adoption of Thunderbird as my email client - this coupled with  the lighting calendar plugin has me pretty much set. <br /><br />This combo  allows meeting requests to be sent to outlook clients with no porblems.<br /><br />All  I need to do now is get push working with my windows mobile PDA when it  gets back from the repairers and I can finally junk using the works SBS  :)</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2007/10/31/pocket-php.html">Pocket PHP</a></h2>
	  <p>I recently discovered a Pocket PC PHP server called PocketHPH.  PocketHPH is available from MobileLeap and runs on various platforms  including the WM5 that my JasJam runs. Also included is SQLite3 support  to allow you to run dabase based php developments.<br /><br />You might  wonder what use running a server on your Mobile phone would be, from my  point of view it could allow me to work on DeeEmm CMS development whilst  on the road without needing to take a laptop with me, although I'm not  sure that it would run in it's current configuration. <br /><br />Currently I  have it loaded up and am using it so that I can test the output of  DeeEmm CMS on a mobile device whilst configuring the mobile css file.<br /><br />Pocket  HPH is free for non commercial use.<br /><br />You can download it from  http://mobileleap.net/hph/</p>
<p>Whilst on the subject of programs  for Windows Mobile 5 I should also mention a few other apps that I find  invaluable.</p>
<p><strong>Minimo</strong> is a miniture version  of Mozilla that is far better than the Internet Explorer that came with  my JasJam. Amongst other things it includes tabbed browsing.</p>
<p>Minimo  is available free for downbload from  http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minimo</p>
<p>If you require a  decent file explorer then look no further than <strong>Total Commander</strong>.  Total Commander  also includes Zip / Ftp / Registry support as well as  all the usual functions expected from a file management program.</p>
<p>Total  Commander is available as freeware from http://www.ghisler.com/ce.htm</p>
<p><strong>World  Card Mobile</strong> is a text recognition program that uses your  phones camera to capture and then convert business cards using OCR so  that the information can be added into your phones contacts. It captures  all ledgible info and automatically recognises the different fields on  the card - for instance it will prefill name, address, phone, email,  position, company name info without any user intervention. Once the info  has been reviewed you simply need to press a button and the info is  automatically added to your contacts.</p>
<p>World Card Mobile is  available from PenPower Technology and costs $24.95</p>
<p>You can  download a 30 day trial of WorldCard Mobile from  http://store.penpowerinc.com/mobile.html</p>
<p>For programing on  a normal PC I use Ultraedit Studio, for programming on my JasJam I use <strong>CEdit.</strong> CEdit is a programmers editor with syntax highlighting (surprisingly  useful on a small device), function listing (very useful to navigate  large programs) and the usual cut / paste / jump to line type stuff.</p>
<p>CEdit  Costs a mere $1.95  and is available as a trial version from   http://www.logicalsky.com/Product_CEdit.htm</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2007/10/11/x10-kit-arrived.html">X10 Kit Arrived</a></h2>
	  <p>I took delivery of my Active Home X10 starter kit yesterday. The kit is  the 7 peice version that includes the Computer interface, appliance  outlet, lamp outlets, bayonet fitting, radio receiver and remote  control. <br /><br />As I already have the mControl demo installed on my  laptop I decided to try and get control of at least one light. I fitted  the bayonet adaptor into my hallway light and then plugged the radio  receiver into a socket outlet. Using the remote I could easily trigger  the appliance adaptor built into the radio receiver; by pressing '1' and  then 'on' I heard a satisfactory click as the relay clicked on and off,  however pressing '2' and then 'on' did not switch the light on as  expected - that is until I realised I needed to obviously leave the  light switch in the on position - D'OH!<br /><br />In less that 5 minutes I  had a working system - I could now turn the hall light on and off from  anywhere in the house and garden (for what pupose I'm not really sure).  The range on the remote control seems very good - I now have it plugged  in at one one of the house and can use the remote from the other with no  problems.<br /><br />So now for the tricky part - getting it to work from  my PC. I put the batteries in the pc adaptor and plugged it in, I then  run the comms cable from the adapator to the comm port on my laptop (the  unit I received is the serial version - a USB version is also  available).<br /><br />With the connections done I opened up the mControl  demo. I created a zone for the Hallway and added an LM14 device as it  did not have an LM15 calling it Hall Light. After I saved it I clicked  on the button to turn the lamp on and hey presto - the light went on!!! <br /><br />So  far so good - this only leaves one thing left to test - My JasJam smart  phone. <br /><br />I have a static IP address as I host some web sites on a  home server which is great for accessing computers whilst i'm away from  home. Its also possible to use some kind of service if you have a  dynamically assigned address that allows you connect to your home  server, but I haven't used this before. <br /><br />Before I could use the  remote interface I created a rule on my firewall to pass port 29990  through to the IP address of my laptop, I then navigated my JasJam's  broswser to http://myipaddress:29990/mobile.aspx<br /> <br />I was  pleasantly surprised to see the zone I had created with the hallway  light in my browser, I could easily turn the light on and off with a  surpringly quick reaction time of only a second or two.<br /><br />mControl  rocks!!! - it worked right 'out of the box' with no fancy configuration  required, the mobile remote access is also great - not only is it  included with the package its easy to use and has well thought out  controls for the small mobile screen.<br /><br />I am more than happy with  the whole system (well - based on installing one light I am - lol) its  easy to setup, use and the mControl software is worth every penny. I  must admit I didn't even load up the software that came with the product  - perhaps this is all you may require but if your're a Media Centre  user I definately reccomend mControl for the integration into the MCE  interface. <br /><br />The browser based access is also great - I tried this  on a small 8" touchscreen which will be the permanent access point for  the whole home automation system, the layout of the mControl interface  works great at this size.<br /><br />All I now need is for the rest of my  X10 parts and the Micro PC to turn up</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2007/10/02/home-automation-part-duex.html">Home Automation Part Duex</a></h2>
	  <p>Regular visitors may remember me mentioning that I had been looking into home automation. My 'research' has lead me to invest in an x10 Active Home starter kit which includes a whole bunch of lamp and appliance controllers and most importantly a PC interface.</p>
<p>This and a bunch of other 'projects' have made me stop work on DMCMS for a while. Work on DMCMS will resume when I've finished the other more important stuff. Anyhows - back to my ramblings...</p>
<p>The PC interface comes with the Active Home software allowing you to program scheduled programs to control the modeules.</p>
<p>The modules themselves are controlled by signals carried through the pre existing power cables of the building, meaning that I dont need to run in a trillion new cables into my 80 year old house.</p>
<p>Whilst the software that comes with the pack is probably fine, I've also been looking at two other packages, both of these packages integrate into Windows Media Centre and also offer remote access via the web. In addition they also offer CCTV integration and access from a PDA / Windows smart phone - handy for when I leave the coffee machine on.</p>
<p>Both packages will also allow access via a browser interface - perfect for the small touch screen controller I've bought to act as a central control point.</p>
<p>The first package is called Harmony and is available from iDomus in the UK (www.iDomus.co.uk). This package looks great and seamlessly integrates into WM, my only problem with this choice is that all of the additional features require additional modules to be purchased - this in itself is not a problem - it's reasonably priced.</p>
<p>However, reasonably priced in the UK suddenly becomes unreasonably priced by the time that the Australian exchange rate is factored in.</p>
<p>My second choice is the mControl package offered by Embedded Automation (http://www.embeddedautomation.com). This appears to offer the same features but all in one package - all for a fraction of the price of the Harmony version. My only gripe is that the interface doesn't look exactly the same as WMC - However - they do offer access to a SDK and offer support via a forum for developers, which means that I can fix that part myself (if I was really bothered that is...)</p>
<p>Although the mControl package is my second choice it's too good value for money - this alone will probably persuade me to go ahead with it.</p>

	  <p>Regular visitors to the site will recal that a few weeks back I mentioned that I was working on a new project. The new project is a software package aimed at making risk assessment easier and more precise. I have decided to split the development of this package away from this site and host it on it's own site. The main reason for this is that it is intended that the package will be a commercial product and for the time being I want to keep DeeEmm as an open source site.

	  <h2><a href="/general/2007/08/05/suggestions-please.html">Suggestions Please</a></h2>
	  <p>Interest in DMCMS has slowly been building over the past few months.  This increased interest has been reflected in the number of downloads  that we have been seeing. Last month saw a total of 142 downloads,  bringing the all time total to 405.<br /><br />The 0.7.0.beta release has  now been bug free for the past month, with no user submitted bugs or  developer bugs being reported within this time.<br /><br />Progress on  0.8.0.beta has been made, with improvements added for the search engine  and the translation functions. The things to do page shows the current  outstanding tasks needed to be acheived before 0.8.0.beta hits the  streets.<br /><br /><strong>0.7.0.beta upgrade</strong></p>
<p>I have been  considering upgrading the 0.7.0.beta release to Release Candidate 1. It  is stable with no known bugs, but obviouosly lacks the additional  functionality offered with the upcoming 0.8.0.beta release - namely the  user management / commenting system.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestions Please</strong></p>
<p>With  version 0.8.0.beta fastly approaching or perhaps even 0.7.0.beta being  promoted to version 1, it is time to make your suggestions and feature  requests known. There has been very little input from users so far and  so we would like to encourage users to get involved and join the forum,  to make suggestions and to post critisiscms that you have with the  software.</p>
<p>As ever, we would like to remind everyone that DMCMS is  still in it's beta stage so if you have tried DMCMS and have not found  it to your liking, why not tell us why. Without your feedback we cannot  develop DMCMS into the tool that YOU want.</p>

	  <p>I've been getting the framework of the safety analysis / risk assessment  software laid out to get a better idea of how to put it all together.  The basic underlying usability is simply to identify, score and then  reduce safety related hazards. The risk assessment process is pretty  straight forward, in fact I have been successfully using a risk  assessment model that I previously developed within excel. Along with  some different reporting options, these will both be carried over to the  software futher down the track.<br /><br />After doing a google I stumbled  across a rival peice of software. Marketed at up to $3300 per floating  user license I decided to take a look to see what the opposition had to  offer (mostly as it offered a free trial).<br /><br />The software was  pretty much as expected, and lacked ease of use for both the hazard  scoring and the reporting functions and nether aided the assessor or  provided any reccomendations based on the results. These are the main  areas where I feel this type of software should be of benefit.<br /><br />The  hazard identification aspect was relatively straight forward with pick  lists to pick from that also incorporated the ability to be able to add  user defined entries. Generally there appeared to be a lot of additional  'value added' aspects but when the extra options were scrutinised they  were no more than gloss and padding. <br /><br />In my mind, not worth the  stated $3300.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2007/07/26/home-automation.html">Home Automation</a></h2>
	  <p>This week I've been delving a little into home automation. Home automation is a topic that I have been meaning to have a look into for quite some time. Being an industrial automation specialist, the home automation sector is a very interesting topic for me as it is something that should be relatively easy to someone of my background to do.<br /><br />Prior to looking into home automation I had a few pre-conceived ideas of usefull facets including modulated signals using domestic AC supply as a carrier wave. It was no surprise to see that this has been adpoted as part of the X10 standard.<br /><br />My personal view of home automation was to utilise a home PC, equipped as a master controller with inputs and outputs to control functions within the house such as lighting and access control. Modern Home Automation system can be much more sophisticated also including audio and video streams throughout the house.<br /><br />Home Automation is a relatively new sector, with relatively few companies providing off the shelf systems that can be catered to suit end user needs. With the utilisation of a development medium such as Visual Basic and a simple I/O interface or perhaps interfacing to the already available X10 standard it may be possible to greatly reduce Home Automation costs.</p>

	  <p>It has been nice to have some time away from the computer this week, perhaps it is something I should do more often. The 'holiday' has given me time to think about stuff like the development that goes on with DMCMS and the amount of time that it takes up. Whilst my current goal is to get it finished off to a standard where it can be realeased as a full and final version I may shift my focus a little and spend some time developing a couple of other ideas I have, ideas that potentially can bring in some revenue.<br /><br />One of the ideas that I would like to spend some time to develop is a risk management package for performing, scoring and recording risk analysis. Risk analysis is the procedure through which hazards are identified, prioritsed and then actions developed to minimise or eliminate the hazard. These hazards may be many and varied and can range from general workplace safety right up to the exotic - like perhaps space exploration. In fact, wherever there is human activity, there exists the possibility of a hazardous situation potentially being able to cause injury or harm. <br /><br />One of the hardest things for most companies / individuals involved in risk assessment is the ability to easily score or 'rate' the hazard. There are several techniques available to achieve this but all of them leave something open to interperetation.<br /><br />My idea is to develop a software package to make this task easier, and provide less room for error. By removing the 'grey' from the descision making process, the task of identifiying the hazards and providing a method of risk control becomes much easer and the need for expensive consultancy can be negated.<br /><br />My ultimate goal is to develop the software into a saleable item, to be sold right here from this site, as after all, the site is intended to be a platform for all my works, not just DMCMS. <br /><br />The software would initially be available on the PC platform, with a later development for mobile devices such as handheld PC's, allowing field operatives to easily carry out risk assessments in the field without having the need for even a laptop. Collected data can then be imported into the main application back at the office when it is more convenient.<br /><br />The coming weeks may see little change for DMCMS as I intend to spend at least a little time developing the initial idea / structure for the application.<br /><br />DM.</p>

	  <p>I will be taking some time out this week to get some stuff done around  the house, this means it is likely that I won't be sitting in front of  my computer too much. I've been spending too much time trying to get  everything finished off and neglecting my chores (which doesn't bode too  well with the better half).<br /><br />After a quick tot-up I estimate that  there are approximately 80 hours work left until the next (and  hoipefully final) release is ready. There are a lot of new features  planned including a full user based commenting / subscription system,  reinstatement of the translation function (obviously working this time  round) as well as a completely redesigned administration interface.<br /><br />A  lot of the work has already been carried out and tested but will  require further testing to make sure that it is reliable enough for  release. The remaining items are either still in development or have yet  to be started.<br /><br />The current release is hopefully stable enough  that it will not cause any problems and so will likely remain as it is  until the final release is ready.<br /><br />Some minor bug fixes have  already been released and the packages updated to reflect the bugs  found. <br /><br />As usual, if you find any errors / problems / bugs then  don't hesitate to bring them to our attention, either as a Bug Tracker  entry or in the forums.<br /><br />DM.</p>

This one is a relatively  simple one to fix and is a by-product of developing for the Linux  envoironment on a Windoze machine.</p>
<p>The bug is simply one that it  caused due to case sensitivity on some linux installations - the  offending files are the language files - the ones supplied with the old  package have 'capitalised' names - ie the first letter is a capital. The  filenames stored in the database start with a lower case letter. Simply  renaming the files will clear up the issue.</p>

The bug didn't appear on any of my test  installations that I carried out before uploading the code for public  consumption but, was still there, none the less.<br /><br />The bug partly  originated from a relic of a past version stuck in the database and  partly from an error in the database backup function, I guess I need to  be more careful in future.<br /><br />DM.</p>

	  <p>{jcomments off}Trying to get the latest incarnation of DMCMS ready for release seems  to be a never ending battle. Just when I thought that I had it licked  something else crops up - and guess what!! - it's yet another IE flaw /  bug / idiosynchracy. After redesigning the admin interface into a nice  tabbed affair that put everything on one page in an easy to digest  format I then find that it doesn't work in explorer. Phah - seems to be  about par for the course recently.</p>
<p>Now whilst this is really  frustrating I wont declare to hate IE and it's odd renderings, after  all, being a Firefox protagonist I am in the minority. IE is also the  browser that I first discovered the internet on, so I must at least owe  it something.</p>
<p>My day today is being spent at home, which is great  as I get to spend some time trying to finish the 0.8.0.beta release off  whilst heating is being installed in the house. It's also great as I am  now within swearing distance of an internet connection so I can try out  some of the stuff that requires connectivity to the world wide wobble  (such as user registration verification).</p>
<p>I've decided to load the  latest offerings onto my webserver at home and test everything out,  first thing I wanted to do was create a new CVS branch for my source  repository - pretty easy stuff. Then I check out the latest branch as a  release so that I can load it onto the server and update the existing  DMCMS test installation.</p>
<p>Wait....WTF???</p>
<p>There seems to be  lots of extra files and folders in the released data - stuff that had  been previously deleted (and commited). TSK.</p>
<p>Try as hard as I  might I can't seem to get a release without the extra files.</p>
<p>I  dont recall this happening before.</p>
<p>Phah - yet another diversion  to keep me from acheiving the goal of getting this thing finished off.</p>
<p>I  may yet give up.</p>
<p>:(</p>
<p><br /><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>I  'fixed' the issue of the old file / folder remains by creating a new CVS  module only containing the new files. I apologise to those of you who  have been checking out files from the dmcms module - you will now need  to redirect your CVS clients to point at dmcms_080. But hey - maybe a  new module for each release is a good idea??</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2007/07/02/admin-style.html">Admin Style</a></h2>
	  <p>{jcomments off}This weekend I've been taking a look at the administration interface  and how it is presented to the user. The admin interface is probably the  biggest part of any CMS, even though it may actually be the least used.  The age old addage is in full effect here - 'first impressions last',  new users trying a CMS for the first time will be more impressed with  how something looks rather than how it functions and will probably  mistake an average interface for a good one if it looks the part. If the  interface doesn't at least look capable, then chances are that the user  will not give it more than a cursory glance before moving on to the  next demo.</p>
<p>Part of my thinking whilst developing DMCMS was to keep  everything very simple - to try and only use basic, compliant HTML /  CSS and as little fancy effects and javascript as possible. Javascript  has unfortunately been employed for a few functions, which I don't think  is too bad, and for the most part there are no frills with the basic  template supplied with DMCMS.</p>
<p>To try and create some kind of  image to the Admin interface I have changed the way that it is  presented. Some functions have been fused together and are now presented  in a tabbed navigation structure. Javascript will be required to be  enabled, but not absolutely necessary as the interface will still  function without it - it will simply not look as good.</p>
<p>Bringing  the different admin functions together into a more condensed interface  acheives the goal of improving the first impressions factor tenfold:  Rather than having to scroll down the page to see all of the different  functions, the user can instantly see scope of what is controlled from  within the interface.</p>
<p>This also allows the possibility of  completely segregating the interface from the rest of the site -  presenting it with it's own style that is not changed as part of the  templating system. This would definately acheive the goal of presenting  an image - something that is recognisable as DMCMS and distinguishable  from other CMS systems.</p>
<p>The final design is still being develped  and is yet to be finalised 100% but it will be available for the 0.8.0  Beta release.</p>

	  <p>{jcomments off}Latest offerings for the upcoming release is a better method of  integration for 3rd party web applications (forums, wikis, etc. etc...).  The current method using the phpBB integration file has been changed  and will be known under a more generic name.</p>
<p>The basic method of  useage is the same - the integration files is called from within the 3rd  party application, the relevent DMCMS bits are created and then  assigned to a local variable allowing the DMCMS parts (header and/or  footer) to be seamlessly stitched into the 3rd party app.</p>
<p>It may  be necessary to modify the 3rd party app so that the DMCMS header /  footer replaces existing logos etc, but this is entirely down to you.</p>
<p>I  revisited this a short time ago due to wanting to add the site footer  onto the bottom of the forum, I've since revisited integration again as I  have now included the DMWiki.</p>
<p>The new files will be available  after the 0.8.0.Beta release as some updated files are required to make  the new method of integration work.</p>

<p>I'm currently working on the backup / alternate method of  user account activation so that, if required, activation can be done by  administrators - this is usefull in cases where there is no access to a  mail server or where site admins like to personally check and manually  enable all registrations.</p>

	  <p>{jcomments off}Work has been progressing towards the next release of DMCMS which will  likely be another major revision due to the amount of changes that have  happened. <br /><br />The template parsing methodology has completely  changed, gone is the fixed layout and instead in it's place is a  template based layout system that allow layouts to be configured within  the template itself. configuration variables can also be set within a  template configuration file allowing complete freedom to template  writers.<br /><br />The user commenting system is also now up and running,  in fact the only thing stopping the next version from being released is  the incomplete user admin system which is currently being finished off.<br /><br />As  usual I have discovered more IE related issues, this time relating to  the layout, it's only a small bug and will be fixed by release time.<br /><br />I  have also spent some time tidying up the code - although there is still  a lot to do.<br /><br />DM.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2007/06/21/recaptcha.html">ReCAPTCHA</a></h2>
	  <p>I just surfed across reCAPTCHA whilst researching some code for DMCMS. reCAPTCHA is a site developed to make better use of the 'Captcha' security devices utilised on most web sites. Captcha's are those pictures with distorted words that you need to type into a box to validate your submission when posting information on the web. They are used to prevent spam by trying to prevent automated scripts from posting information. The basic idea behind reCAPTCHA is that it uses Captchas to convert text scanned from books (the captcha picture) by validating and then storing the result - thus allowing books that cannot be recognised with OCR software to be converted into the digital format. A great idea!<br /><br />I am currently looking into integrating reCAPTCHA into DMCMS for user comment validation</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2007/06/08/070beta.html">0.7.0.BETA</a></h2>
	  <p>{jcomments off}DMCMS.0.7.0.BETA is very nearly here. The files are finished and  uploaded to SF.Net's servers but I just can't seem to add them to the  download section. <br /><br />It might be my dodgy wireless internet card   :cry: <br /><br />Hopefully I can finish the job when I get home later on.<br /><br />The  0.7.0.Beta update is a major update from the previous version (hence  it's jump from version 0.6.X to 0.7.X) practically all of the files have  been changed. The changes are mostly to address problems with how the  site is rendered in Internet Explorer. which for the most part I have  not taken care of due to mostly developing in Firefox.<br /><br />Hopefully  now I have stopped alienating IE users by actually releasing something  they can see/use the site traffic should go up and someone might  actually join the forum.</p>

<p><br />All  current bugs have been fixed in this version and some feature requests  have also been incorporated. The main outstanding feature of user  commenting has been postponed until a later release so that this release  could be issued in a timely manner, work is already well underway on  getting the next release finished.<br /><br />DM.</p>

	  <p>{jcomments off}It's just come to my attention that there are a few issues for Internet  Explorer 6 users. This is mainly that the drop down menus do not work. A  fix is being worked on at the moment, it will hopefully be ready for  the 0.6.5 release this week.<br /><br />DM.</p>

	  <h2><a href="/general/2006/06/05/ie6-display-issues-fixed.html">IE6 Display Issues Fixed</a></h2>
	  <p>{jcomments off}The IE6 display issued have been traced to a simple spelling mistake  (actually incorrect case on one character in a javascript function). The  site has been updated but the fix will not be available until the  release of version 0.6.5.beta. <br /><br />Work on 0.6.5.beta is currently  progressing at a very fast rate, it is anticipated that it will be ready  by the end of this week. Both the site and the demo site have been  updated to the latest development ;evel.<br /><br />The Demo site is now  also using the DMCMS template. There are still some issues to sort out  with the template (mostly relating to IE6 not being able to correctly  display PNG transparency) these will be addressed before the 0.6.5.beta  release.<br /><br />For those of you who cannot wait until then for the IE6  drop down menu bugfix - simply make sure the term 'sfhover' is all lower  case in the following files - /templates/.../banner.tpl  &amp;   /templates/.../css/default.css<br /><br />Also, for those who cannot wait  for the rest of 0.6.5.beta - all current changes are commited to the CVS  repository - so you can checkout your own version.<br /><br /><img src="../tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-wink.gif" border="0" alt="Wink" title="Wink" /><br /><br />DM.</p>
