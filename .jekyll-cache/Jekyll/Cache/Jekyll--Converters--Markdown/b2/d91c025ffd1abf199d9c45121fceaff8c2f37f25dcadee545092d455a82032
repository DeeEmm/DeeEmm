I"ê<p>I've just updated the mod that converts all threaded comments into flat style comments. The original mod had an issue with the wall posts where it hid the reply button. This issue is now resolved. The mod can be downloaded from either the store here - or the Boonex marketplace.</p>
<p>There are also a few new Dolphin tutorials in the resources section:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to add a youtube button to TinyMCE</li>
<li>How to remove / edit the Join button on the promo banner</li>
<li>How to remove the checkboxes fron the keyword search page</li>
<li>How to increase the size fo the test in the comments box</li>
</ul>
<div>These are simply recent posts that I've replied to over at the unity forums, but seeing as the search over there is non-functional, I've decided to also post them here. Don't forget to check back often, as&nbsp;I will add to these when I get time.</div>
