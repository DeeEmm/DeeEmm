I"(<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>Last week <a href="https://deeemm.com/index.php/entry/general/diy-extruder-auger-machine-part-1" title="" class="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I wrote about the extruder screw that I'm making</a> and shared the initial build of a machine to make my own screw. In that post I created the basic table using an auger as a lead screw. This proved the concept of using an auger as the transport mechanism but when I started to build the second part, the mechanism that holds the grinder, I found that the auger was mounted&nbsp;too low in the frame&nbsp;and so&nbsp;the grinding wheel would not be able to reach the workpiece.&nbsp;So before I could get stuck into mounting the grinder I needed to move the 'lead screw' up on top of the frame.</p><p><br /></p></div>

<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>Moving the lead screw&nbsp;also allowed me to change&nbsp;the design a little. After my initial tests you may recall that I decided that the nut design I had come up with was overly complex, in fact after doing some more experimenting I decided that the auger did not need to be held captive and&nbsp;enclosed within a nut at all. What I decided to do was simply run a bit of round bar over the top of the auger (I actually used a bolt as it was a little harder than round bar). The bolt is welded to the top of the slides and&nbsp;held against the top of the&nbsp;auger. The auger itself was positioned such that it engaged with the bolt with as little play as possible. Once I was happy with how everything was positioned I tacked it together and tested it out. The result is pretty good. It's not quite as smooth as the previous version with the bearings, but considering that the goal is to be able to make this with easily accessible materials and hand tools it's a win.</p><p><br /></p></div>
