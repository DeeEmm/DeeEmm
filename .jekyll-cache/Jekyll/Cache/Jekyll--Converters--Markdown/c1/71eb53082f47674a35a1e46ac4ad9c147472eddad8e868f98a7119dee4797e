I"-<p>Just released two new mods for the Boonex Dolphin platform.</p>
<p>The first mod is a Dolphin 6 mod that changes the standard threaded comments layout to a normal flat comment structure. All existing comments are changed to the new layout, as will all new comments.</p>
<p>The second modification is a Dolphin 7 MOD that creates a custom block for the groups home / view page that aggregates the groups forum posts.&nbsp; This increases the usefulness of the groups home page by providing all information in one place.</p>
<p>As a bonus, we have also included an additional mod that will show you how to add a block anywhere on your site to aggregate ALL group forum posts into one block.</p>
<p>Both mods are available for purchase either here, via the webstore, or via the Boonex marketplace.</p>
