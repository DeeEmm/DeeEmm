I"O<p>Apologies to those of you who have trie to access the ticket system and were unable to lodge new support tickets. Unfortunately there was a bug in the latest version of the Ticket System software that powers the support section of the site which caused an issue on the 'New Ticket' page. This issue has now been remedied.&nbsp;</p>
