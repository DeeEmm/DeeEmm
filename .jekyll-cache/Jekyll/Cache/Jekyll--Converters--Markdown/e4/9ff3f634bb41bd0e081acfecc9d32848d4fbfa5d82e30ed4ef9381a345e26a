<p>A recent hard drive failure has forced me to purchase myself a long  overdue new laptop. I ended up purchasing a nice Asus F3. The machine is  a lot better than my old Dell 505 which has served me well for the past  four years but unfortunately came installed with vista. A long time  user of Dell products, I decided on the F3 as it has a very similar feel  to the 505, which after struggling with my Toshiba Tecra at work was  very important to me (the tecra has a number of really annoying features  / non-features such as no right hand control button, windows button at  top of keyboard, lack of bluetooth etc etc...)<br /><br />The spec of the  machine is much better than my dell and should see me ok for the next  few years.<br /><br />Originally I had considered changing to macs but the  extortionate price of the macbook pro gave me trouble justifying it. My  next choice was very obviously Dell, but as I really needed to pick  something up this weekend I was left with little choice than to change  manufacturer.<br /><br />Being a writer of open source code I decided that  it was also long overdue to replace my aging office suite with a better  and open source version - especially as I dont think my old version is  compatible with vista.<br /><br />I've tried open office before - it came  bundled with a fedora installation that I installed and I also installed  / uninstalled it from my old laptop. this time though - I've decided  that I will not give in to the pressure of installing office instead.<br /><br />Browsing  duties go exclusively to Firefox of course, but with the addition of  Internet Exploder / Opera and now Safari  for testing purposes.  Unfortunately the ieolas standalone version of IE6 no longer works :(<br /><br />(deja  vu)<br /><br />Another product that I've downloaded is netbeans - an open  source and cross platform IDE supporting multiple languages. I've yet to  use it and so cannot tell if it can replace visual studio express for  me - I will keep you all posted.<br /><br />I previously used sharpsoft but  ended up replacing it with visual studio express as it was a little too  buggy.<br /><br /><br />I'm embarking on a project to develop a desktop app -  its a basic data handling and reporting app - I'm tempted to use the  java portion of netbeans to write this - both as a test of the IDE and  also to end up with a x-platform app.<br /><br /><br />Another change for me  is the adoption of Thunderbird as my email client - this coupled with  the lighting calendar plugin has me pretty much set. <br /><br />This combo  allows meeting requests to be sent to outlook clients with no porblems.<br /><br />All  I need to do now is get push working with my windows mobile PDA when it  gets back from the repairers and I can finally junk using the works SBS  :)</p>
