I"½<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>Way back in 2013 I bought a Rumba board for my 3DR printer build. Unfortunately it had a bit if an issue with the USB chip and so the unreliable USB connectivity made it practically unusable. As far as I recall I could never even get a program loaded up, so it's been sitting in the original box that it shipped in ever since. Cue&nbsp;2019 and I've been putting together an MPCNC for a project and decided that I'd really like to get the Rumba board up and running so that I can take advantage of the six stepper drivers it has.<br /><br /></p></div>

<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text"><p>Back in 2013, for whatever reason I never bothered to try and fix the issue with&nbsp;the Rumba board, and so it sat on the shelf unloved and unused. I think I managed to get as far as realising that I was not alone with Rumba USB issues as others were experiencing the same problem as me. Unfortunately, whilst there was some comraderie in shared pain, no one had any answers for me as not only was my Rumba board broken, but I also used a Mac, which meant that there was zero pooled experience to draw upon. I was on my own. And so the net result was that it probably went into the <em data-redactor-tag="em" data-verified="redactor">too hard basket</em>&nbsp;to wait for another day.&nbsp;Well it's reprieve came this week when I decided to take a look at trying to revive it.<br /></p><p>I ordered a USBasp programming interface so that I could re-flash the firmware in the USB controller. The USB comms is handled by an&nbsp;atmega16u2, which can be re-flashed if required. The process is not super difficult but existing online tutorials do not explain things too well.<br /><br />You'll need a six pin connector for your USBasp programmer to mate with the ICSP header on the Rumba. If, like me your USBasp lead comes with a 10 pin plug you can easily make a temporary adaptor from some male / female jumper wires using the following pin outs</p><p><br /></p></div>
