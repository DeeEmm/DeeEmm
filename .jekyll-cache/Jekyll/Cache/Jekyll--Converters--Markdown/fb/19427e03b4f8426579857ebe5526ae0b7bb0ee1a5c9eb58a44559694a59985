I"Ì<p>Regular readers would remember my look into IDE's / Programming  Editors for the Linux platform from the last post. My main reason for  this was to try and find something to replace Ultraedit Studio which has  been my weapon of choice for coding for the past 7 or 8 years. Well,  I've possibly found a better alternative - running Ultraedit 'natively'  on Linux!<br /><br />No, unfortunately IDM have not decided to port UE for  Linux (although more on that below...), I have discovered Wine. Wine is  an application layer that allows Windoze applications to run on Linux by  allowing access to dll files.<br /><br />The Wine website has an  application database that lists applications tested with Wine, this  ranges from applications like UEdit to PC based games. There are several  entries listed for Ultraedit - namely different versions. There are  some reports that ftp functionality does not work or is limited but  generally it appears that Ultraedit functions fine. The Database entry  can be viewed <a href="http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=7307" target="_blank">HERE</a> and the Wine Home page can be viewed HERE</p>
<p>Installation  of Wine in Ubuntu is easy - simply choose Wine in the Synaptic Package  Manager. Wine is also available for other flavours of linux, with  installation options to suit each.</p>
<p>After installing Wine, you will  now need to download a copy of Ultraedit to your linux box. I've chosen  to download and install Ultraedit Studio. Installation involves setting  the exe file to open with Wine - this can be easily done by right  clicking on the file and choosing 'open with other application'.</p>
<p>A  bit of a tip - I found that if I chose the custom installation it would  fall over trying to register wodCertificate.dll - wheras choosing the  typical installation had no problems.</p>
<p>After the Installation  process has been run you should now have a working copy of Ultraedit.</p>
<p>If  you don't like the appearance you can install theme files but general  reports of these are that they do have an effect an performance. THIS  thread over at 'Linux for Designers' shows how you can modify the  registry settings within Wine to change it's appearance to something a  little easier on the eyes.</p>
<p>Whilst on the topic of Linux for  Designers - I noticed a link there to <a href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page" target="_blank">IEs 4 Linux</a> a packaged installation allowing  Internet Explorer 5, 6 and 7 to be run under Wine in Linux (and also  OSX). Testing under IE 6 and 7 is a must for web developers (and some  would argue testing under IE5 is also a necessity), Under windows XP I  used to use IEolas to run IE6 alongside IE7 for testing, but this  stopped working with the introduction of Vista.</p>
<p>The IEs 4 Linux  package is easily installed by following the instructions <a href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Installation" target="_blank">HERE</a> - Internet Explorer 5 and 6 can be installed by  checking the checkboxes on the installer dialog that appears - if you  want to install IE7 you will also need to click the advanced button and  select the checkbox there as well.</p>

<p>UPDATE!!  2007-12-28 13:08:47</p>
<p>After a little googling and came across <a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/index.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=10&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=120" target="_blank">THIS</a> thread over at the Ultraedit Forums - Check  the post by penntapp near the bottom of the page. It would appear that a  Linux version is currently being worked on for realease in late 2008.</p>
<p>This  is great news!! (As you can see I've already offered my services as a  beta tester)</p>
