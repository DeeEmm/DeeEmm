I"œ<p>With the first working week of the year at an end I am very pleased  with myself - not only have I managed to release two DMCMS updates but I  have also managed to keep my other resolutions too. The long long  overdue security update was rolled out in Version 0.7.1 closely followed  by another version to address a couple of small issues that were missed  with the first release. Whilst only up for  few hours the Version 0.7.1  release had 20 downloads - thats a lot of interest in such a short  period of time - hopefully this is an indication of things to come.<br /><br />Work  has continued on the Version 0.8.0 release with a number of items being  crossed off of the To Do list. In a bid to keep visitors more informed I  have added a 'Current Task' to the To Do page to indicate what I'm  currently working on, I also split out the list into items scheduled for  the next release (To Do List) and items for later releases (Wish List) -  this has allowed me to review and remove a few items from the 0.8.0  release to speed up it's release. Hopefully this should provide an  accurate status for future project development.<br /><br /><strong>Have you  visited ohloh.net?</strong></p>
<p>Also worthy of mention is <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/" target="_blank">http://www.ohloh.net</a> -  Ohloh was started up in 2004 as a way of providing more visitbility into  software development. Utilising a number of aids ohloh provides  analytical data and project overviews in an easy to read format.  Statistics can be viewed for both projects and contributors alike. In  addition Kudos points can be awarded between members. Members can also  add projects to 'Stacks' (a personal colletions of projects) allowing  projects to be suggested to them based on common choices.</p>
<p>Naturally  I added DMCMS as a project. The project page proides entries for RSS  feeds, descriptions and after adding CVS information a breakdown of the  content of the project is displayed.</p>
<p>Amusingly the breakdown  indicates that it would cost you approximately $844,130 if you wanted to  hire a team to replicate DMCMS - And to think I gave it away for free -  surely THAT should give me some kudos points.</p>
