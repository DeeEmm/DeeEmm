<p>{jcomments off}The IE6 display issued have been traced to a simple spelling mistake  (actually incorrect case on one character in a javascript function). The  site has been updated but the fix will not be available until the  release of version 0.6.5.beta. <br /><br />Work on 0.6.5.beta is currently  progressing at a very fast rate, it is anticipated that it will be ready  by the end of this week. Both the site and the demo site have been  updated to the latest development ;evel.<br /><br />The Demo site is now  also using the DMCMS template. There are still some issues to sort out  with the template (mostly relating to IE6 not being able to correctly  display PNG transparency) these will be addressed before the 0.6.5.beta  release.<br /><br />For those of you who cannot wait until then for the IE6  drop down menu bugfix - simply make sure the term 'sfhover' is all lower  case in the following files - /templates/.../banner.tpl  &amp;   /templates/.../css/default.css<br /><br />Also, for those who cannot wait  for the rest of 0.6.5.beta - all current changes are commited to the CVS  repository - so you can checkout your own version.<br /><br /><img src="../tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-wink.gif" border="0" alt="Wink" title="Wink" /><br /><br />DM.</p>
