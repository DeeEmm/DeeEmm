<p>{jcomments off}DMCMS.0.7.0.BETA is very nearly here. The files are finished and  uploaded to SF.Net's servers but I just can't seem to add them to the  download section. <br /><br />It might be my dodgy wireless internet card   :cry: <br /><br />Hopefully I can finish the job when I get home later on.<br /><br />The  0.7.0.Beta update is a major update from the previous version (hence  it's jump from version 0.6.X to 0.7.X) practically all of the files have  been changed. The changes are mostly to address problems with how the  site is rendered in Internet Explorer. which for the most part I have  not taken care of due to mostly developing in Firefox.<br /><br />Hopefully  now I have stopped alienating IE users by actually releasing something  they can see/use the site traffic should go up and someone might  actually join the forum.</p>

<p><br />All  current bugs have been fixed in this version and some feature requests  have also been incorporated. The main outstanding feature of user  commenting has been postponed until a later release so that this release  could be issued in a timely manner, work is already well underway on  getting the next release finished.<br /><br />DM.</p>
