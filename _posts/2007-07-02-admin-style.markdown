<p>{jcomments off}This weekend I've been taking a look at the administration interface  and how it is presented to the user. The admin interface is probably the  biggest part of any CMS, even though it may actually be the least used.  The age old addage is in full effect here - 'first impressions last',  new users trying a CMS for the first time will be more impressed with  how something looks rather than how it functions and will probably  mistake an average interface for a good one if it looks the part. If the  interface doesn't at least look capable, then chances are that the user  will not give it more than a cursory glance before moving on to the  next demo.</p>
<p>Part of my thinking whilst developing DMCMS was to keep  everything very simple - to try and only use basic, compliant HTML /  CSS and as little fancy effects and javascript as possible. Javascript  has unfortunately been employed for a few functions, which I don't think  is too bad, and for the most part there are no frills with the basic  template supplied with DMCMS.</p>
<p>To try and create some kind of  image to the Admin interface I have changed the way that it is  presented. Some functions have been fused together and are now presented  in a tabbed navigation structure. Javascript will be required to be  enabled, but not absolutely necessary as the interface will still  function without it - it will simply not look as good.</p>
<p>Bringing  the different admin functions together into a more condensed interface  acheives the goal of improving the first impressions factor tenfold:  Rather than having to scroll down the page to see all of the different  functions, the user can instantly see scope of what is controlled from  within the interface.</p>
<p>This also allows the possibility of  completely segregating the interface from the rest of the site -  presenting it with it's own style that is not changed as part of the  templating system. This would definately acheive the goal of presenting  an image - something that is recognisable as DMCMS and distinguishable  from other CMS systems.</p>
<p>The final design is still being develped  and is yet to be finalised 100% but it will be available for the 0.8.0  Beta release.</p>
