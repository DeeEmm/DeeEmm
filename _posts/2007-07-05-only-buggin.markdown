<p>You may have noticed from the news flash that the DMCMS.0.7.0.BETA  release has a bug in the SQL database file. This has hopefully now been  sorted out - the files in the download area have been updated and an  updated file is available to download should you require.<br /><br />The  bug, whilst only a minor thing (I say this only because we are still in  BETA) goes to show how difficult it is to cater for every platform and  server software version. The bug didn't appear on any of my test  installations that I carried out before uploading the code for public  consumption but, was still there, none the less.<br /><br />The bug partly  originated from a relic of a past version stuck in the database and  partly from an error in the database backup function, I guess I need to  be more careful in future.<br /><br />DM.</p>
