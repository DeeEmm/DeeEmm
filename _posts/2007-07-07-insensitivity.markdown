<p>In my haste to get the last version released it would appear that I  wasn't thorough enough with testing it to make sure everything was okay -  That's Right!!!! (We've hit another bug). This one is a relatively  simple one to fix and is a by-product of developing for the Linux  envoironment on a Windoze machine.</p>
<p>The bug is simply one that it  caused due to case sensitivity on some linux installations - the  offending files are the language files - the ones supplied with the old  package have 'capitalised' names - ie the first letter is a capital. The  filenames stored in the database start with a lower case letter. Simply  renaming the files will clear up the issue.</p>
<p>As usual the  downloadable packages have been updated (a big sorry to all those who  have already had a problem with them).</p>
<p>DM.</p>
