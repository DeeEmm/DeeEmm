<p>Regular visitors to the site will recal that a few weeks back I mentioned that I was working on a new project. The new project is a software package aimed at making risk assessment easier and more precise. I have decided to split the development of this package away from this site and host it on it's own site. The main reason for this is that it is intended that the package will be a commercial product and for the time being I want to keep DeeEmm as an open source site. The other reason is simply one of branding.<br><br>For the time being I intend to keep everything under wraps but as usual - watch this space!!!</p>
