<p>I recently discovered a Pocket PC PHP server called PocketHPH.  PocketHPH is available from MobileLeap and runs on various platforms  including the WM5 that my JasJam runs. Also included is SQLite3 support  to allow you to run dabase based php developments.<br /><br />You might  wonder what use running a server on your Mobile phone would be, from my  point of view it could allow me to work on DeeEmm CMS development whilst  on the road without needing to take a laptop with me, although I'm not  sure that it would run in it's current configuration. <br /><br />Currently I  have it loaded up and am using it so that I can test the output of  DeeEmm CMS on a mobile device whilst configuring the mobile css file.<br /><br />Pocket  HPH is free for non commercial use.<br /><br />You can download it from  http://mobileleap.net/hph/</p>
<p>Whilst on the subject of programs  for Windows Mobile 5 I should also mention a few other apps that I find  invaluable.</p>
<p><strong>Minimo</strong> is a miniture version  of Mozilla that is far better than the Internet Explorer that came with  my JasJam. Amongst other things it includes tabbed browsing.</p>
<p>Minimo  is available free for downbload from  http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minimo</p>
<p>If you require a  decent file explorer then look no further than <strong>Total Commander</strong>.  Total Commander  also includes Zip / Ftp / Registry support as well as  all the usual functions expected from a file management program.</p>
<p>Total  Commander is available as freeware from http://www.ghisler.com/ce.htm</p>
<p><strong>World  Card Mobile</strong> is a text recognition program that uses your  phones camera to capture and then convert business cards using OCR so  that the information can be added into your phones contacts. It captures  all ledgible info and automatically recognises the different fields on  the card - for instance it will prefill name, address, phone, email,  position, company name info without any user intervention. Once the info  has been reviewed you simply need to press a button and the info is  automatically added to your contacts.</p>
<p>World Card Mobile is  available from PenPower Technology and costs $24.95</p>
<p>You can  download a 30 day trial of WorldCard Mobile from  http://store.penpowerinc.com/mobile.html</p>
<p>For programing on  a normal PC I use Ultraedit Studio, for programming on my JasJam I use <strong>CEdit.</strong> CEdit is a programmers editor with syntax highlighting (surprisingly  useful on a small device), function listing (very useful to navigate  large programs) and the usual cut / paste / jump to line type stuff.</p>
<p>CEdit  Costs a mere $1.95  and is available as a trial version from   http://www.logicalsky.com/Product_CEdit.htm</p>
