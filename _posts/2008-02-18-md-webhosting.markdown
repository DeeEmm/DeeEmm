<p>Regular visitors will have noticed that the site has been out of action for a number of weeks now - this is due to my web hosting providers poor service. I have been plagued by bad service from this provider since I started hosting with them last year - access to the email server would stop, as would access to the site, then it would start, then stop again... this seemed to be hourly.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br> No amount of service calls seemed to bring about a resolution - the tech team's standard response seems to be clear your browsers cookies and then restart your browser... mmmmmnnn... ok? <br><br> Well, a recent security breach left me pretty pissed - my site was hacked, filled with phishing software and then used as a launchpad for a spam assault - it would appear that the security breach was server wide - no doubt someone gaining access as root. I lost my site when they deleted it - with no warning and then had all my service requests ignored. All I can say is it is a good job that this site is not for profit - if I relied on it for an income I would be bankrupt by now. <br><br> Well enough was enough - I've now changed providers - hopefully the service should be a lot better. <br><br> Mind you, I had the last laugh yesterday when MD Webhosting's site was down again - they're probably still getting hacked. <br><br> My advice to anyone thinking of using MD Webhosting - DONT! They're not the cheapest and they're far from the best. <br><br> Anyhows - that's enough ranting from me - Just thought I'd add to the plethora of Google results that say MD Webhosting suck - guess I should have read a bit deeper before deciding to go with them. <br><br> Please be patient whilst I get the site back up and running, hopefully it shouldn't take too long. I'm limited for time at the moment so you may have to wait a while before I get the forum and Wiki back up. <br><br> DM.</p>

<p>UPDATE: 13:54:55&nbsp; 2008-02-22 - The Wiki and Forum are now back online. However I have not been able to restore the Wiki backup - I may use this as an excuse to rewrite it.</p>
