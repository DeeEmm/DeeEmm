<p>Well the new tax year here in Australia has brought change for in the guise of a new job. It's been a case of out with the old and in with the new as I have quit my old job and set up a company for industrial automation and software. For the past 3 or 4 years I have been working for an engineering company trying to set up an automation department for them, Unfortunately it's too much work for one person, and with little support and even less apparent interest from my employer I decided that I might as well put my effort into something that I would at least benefit from.<br><br>At present I'm still setting things up, but look out for an announcement in the near future with further details. You can rest assured that there will be a website that uses the DMCMS code, and that there will be a bit of cross promotional marketing. If you're in need of software development or would like to employ an automation consultant - give me a shout.<br><br>Another new development is that progress is being made on the 0.8.0 version and I have pretty much decided that the current 0.7.3 release should be released as a 'lite' version of the software. Generally I consider it to be stable, and whilst it may not be so pretty around the edges it deserves to live on rather than be simply discarded when the 0.8.0 version is released.<br><br>The main differences between the two versions are that the 0.7.3 version has no user management outside of the appointment of additional admin users, whereas the 0.8.0 version has a full user permissioning and access rights system.<br><br>I will take the time to tidy up the 0.7.3 admin interface to bring it into line with the 0.8.0 version and then schedule a release candidate for testing. <br><br>Watch this space......<br><br>DM.</p>
