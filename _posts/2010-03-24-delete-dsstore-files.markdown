<p>Whilst recently packaging some files for distribution, I noticed that that the folders that i was compressing contained .DS_Store files. These .DS_Store files are hidden files used by OSX to store metadata such as icon position and view settings. They are similar to the thumbs.db file used on windows, and are equally annoying when packaging files up for viewing on other systems.</p>
<p>By default the .DS_Store files are hidden in OSX, unfortunately this is not so for other systems where they are displayed alongside whatever content you packaged Not wanting to have to manually drill down through various folder levels to delete each and every instance, I decided to have a quick google to see what I could find.</p>
<p>First page up led me to <a href="http://software.ryangrier.com/archives/" target="_blank" title="http://software.ryangrier.com/archives/">Ryan Grier's site</a>, where he has an application called the 'DS_Store Cleaner v1.5' listed. The app has not apparently been updated since January 2005, but this is not an issue, as the app works perfectly.</p>
<p>Basically after unzipping the app, place it somewhere on your mac (the application folder seems like a good spot) and then drag it to your dock to create an icon. Now simply drag the folder you want cleaned onto the DS_Store Cleaner icon. After chugging away for a little while, you will be notified by an alret box as to how many .DS_Store files have been deleted.</p>
<p>The App is no longer maintained, but as it works fine on my copy of Leopard, this does not seem to be an issue, my only criticism is that some kind of progress indicator would be handy.</p>
<p>You can download the app from the Authors site - <a href="http://software.ryangrier.com/archives/" target="_blank" title="http://software.ryangrier.com/archives/">http://software.ryangrier.com/archives/</a></p>
