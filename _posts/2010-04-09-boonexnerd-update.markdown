<p>Just had a bit of a chat with James Tadeo, who has recently updated his successful Boonex support site <a href="http://www.boonexnerd.net" title="http://www.boonexnerd.net">BoonexNerd.net</a> to run from the latest Dolphin version - 7.0.0. James <a href="http://www.boonexnerd.net/dolphin-7/blogs/entry/Site-Update-to-Dolphin-7-in-Progress" title="http://www.boonexnerd.net/dolphin-7/blogs/entry/Site-Update-to-Dolphin-7-in-Progress">blogged</a> about the migration which he said went fairly smoothly using the migration tool that comes with D7, great news to hear for those of us who have still yet to update.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about the update to my own Dolphin site. I started to have a look at this a little while back - i set up a fresh D7 installation, which had a few issues as I had to reconfigure the server setup to suit D7. then I made a start with the data migration tool. I got as far as transferring the user-base over, but have been pretty busy since, and so have never progressed any further.This is something that I really need to make some time to go and sort out.</p>
<p>My main concern was that my D6 site is fairly modified, and whilst D7 does have greatly improved functionality, it does lack some of the mods that my members have come to expect. These mods are a mixture of purchased mods and mods that I have developed myself. There are also a large number of minor enhancements and bug-fixes that are hopefully now covered by the new D7 feature-set. the site has been developed over the past year, which is a nice and comfortable time frame to have developed a site this modded. Unfortunately with the upgrade, time is not that plentiful.</p>
<p>At present I think I will wait for the D 7.0.1. update to be released before revisiting the upgrade. I will have a look into rewriting the current mods for D7 and see how much work is involved, maybe I can temporarily drop a few of the mods to buy a bit of time.</p>
<p>Will keep you posted.</p>
