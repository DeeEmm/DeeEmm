<p>We have just released a free module that allows you to easily enable / disable your website. This is a great help for performing&nbsp;maintenance&nbsp;tasks such as adding modifications or backing up.</p>
<p>The module is easily installed within the standard Dolphin module structure, and requires a small modification to one file to be able to utilise.</p>
<p>The module provides an easy place to edit a maintenance page that will be displayed in the browser to visitors when the site is disabled.</p>
<p>There are future plans to add additional features to the basic module, so if you have an idea for s setting that you feel should be included, just let me know.</p>
<p>The module is available for download from the store or over at the Boonex marketplace.</p>
