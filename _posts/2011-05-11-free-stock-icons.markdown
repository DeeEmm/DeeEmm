<p>Occasionally I need to use icons in an application or website, generally I favour the 'standard' stock icon sets like the fantastic and widely used&nbsp;<a href="http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/" title="http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/">FamFam Silk</a> icon set or <a href="http://somerandomdude.com/projects/bitcons/" title="http://somerandomdude.com/projects/bitcons/">Bitcons by Somerandomdude</a> which I utilised in earlier versions of DMCMS. but recently I needed a larger icon set to create buttons for an admin panel that I was putting together for a web based application.</p>
<p>After the usual google search I stumbled across <a href="http://icons.mysitemyway.com/" title="http://icons.mysitemyway.com/">http://icons.mysitemyway.com/</a> which offer 66 different themed icon sets each based on the same basic pictographs. Each icon set is divided into several categories, such as business or social media and can be downloaded separately. In total there are 128,743 royalty free icons and clipart images available.</p>
<p>The quality and variety of each icon set is fantastic and diverse enough that there is a style available to suit pretty much most application and website designs. I managed to find a 'safety' themed icon set called <a href="http://icons.mysitemyway.com/category/yellow-road-sign-icons/" title="http://icons.mysitemyway.com/category/yellow-road-sign-icons/">yellow road signs</a> that perfectly suited the application I am working on. But what was even more impressive was that the icons set included enough of a variety of icons, that I managed to cover every single icon type that I required, without having to create additional icons myself.</p>
<p>A big thumbs up to mysitemyway for their generosity in giving these icons away, if you need an icon set in the near future, be sure to go check them out. I will definitely be considering them for future apps that I write. A big 10/10 from me.</p>
