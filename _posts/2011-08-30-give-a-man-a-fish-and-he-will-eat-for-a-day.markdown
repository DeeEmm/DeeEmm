<p>It's very nearly here. The Dolphin 'Fish Script' to JomSocial migration script is just around the corner.</p>
<p>To continue on with the theme so affectionately adopted by Boonex, I have decided to give the script a nautical name. So with respect to Jules Vernes <em>Twenty thousand leagues under the sea</em> I have named it the Nautilus.</p>
<p>For those of you who have been patiently awaiting me to pull my finger out and get the script written, you will be happy to learn that I only have a few more tables to migrate and it will be finished (after testing of course).</p>
<p>So, just to raise the tension a little, and build the anticipation (in the best Boonex style - LOL)</p>
<p>Watch this space...</p>
