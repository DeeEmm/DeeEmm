<p>Something new is happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The past few weeks I have been rejigging all of my sites, services and applications so that they all now fall under the banner of my company <a href="http://indau.com.au" target="_blank">Indau</a>. The reason for this is that there was no direct correlation between each of the products. This autonomy also failed to leverage a very important commodity - diversity.</p>
<p>By associating all of my different products with my company, it demonstrates the diversity in the work that I do, and therefore work that the company is able to provide. It helps sell my services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reshuffle is partially due to expansion in a new direction, it also helps me to delineate paying projects from hobby projects. Not that hobby projects are without value, indeed the opposite is true. &nbsp;Whilst undertaking the reshuffle I also decided to revive &nbsp;my long suffering content management system. DMCMS. The reason for this is partially because I want to play with the fantastic tools on offer by the guys at Atlassian, but also because it deserves to live on.</p>
<p>After a quick review of the code with a fresh mind, the roadblock that prevented the version 1 release is readily apparent, the multi language support was weighing the code down and preventing progress. The first job is therefore to remove the bloat associated with the multi-language support and provide a functioning version 1 release.</p>
<p>To give DMCMS a new lease of life, and an identity of it's own I have registered <a href="DeeEmm.org" target="_blank">DeeEmm.org</a> so that it can reside in it's own space, with no distractions from the crap that goes on here at DeeEmm.com</p>
<p>It might take a few days to get things up and running but considering that there has been no movement on DMCMS in about 2 years I'm sure that should not be a problem.</p>
<p>/DM</p>
