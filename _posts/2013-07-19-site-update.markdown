<p>Decided to update the site and freshen it up a little.</p>
<p>The template is now based on the popular Twitter boostrap template and some of the superfluous areas of the sites have been removed. The discussions area is now no more. I figure that I'm not developing commercial components any more so there is really no need for it, instead I will simply support each mod / tutorial through it's comment section.</p>
<p>Whilst on the subject of comments handling, I decided to stop using the excellent Komento and instead simply reply on the inbuilt comments system for EasyBlog. This is more than adequate and running a skinnier site is going to be much easier to manage.</p>
<p>There are numerous other changes, most of them minor and none really that noticeable so that's it for another year or so until the next update.</p>
<p>Now all I need to do is make some new posts.</p>
<p>/DM</p>
