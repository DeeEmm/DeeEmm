Now this is a cool project. I have one of those VR headsets that you can put your iPhone into, but the main issue is that there is no easy pathway to using it as a monitor unless you jailbreak the phone. I tried in vain for a while to set it up so that we could play minecraft but had limited success. Other options seemed to be get an android device or a Samsung Galaxy. This on the other hand looks like it will do the job nicely
