<div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text" ><p>&nbsp;I've had a marine aquarium for the past 12 years. Over this time I have battled with water quality parameters and algae issues. Most of these issues have been related to poor or inadequate&nbsp;husbandry as to be frank, whilst I love my aquarium, it can be a massive time hog and I'm always very time poor.&nbsp;So just recently I've been having another crack at getting my water parameters in check and trying to keep them there</p></div><div class="ebd-block  " data-type="readmore" ></div><div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text" ><p>My tank is a 5 footer with a heap of live rock, DSB in the sump, an el-cheapo skimmer and a power head. I've been dosing Randys 2 part for the past few years and it's probably about 6 years since I last did&nbsp;a water change. My tank params have always been on the high side for nitrates and phosphates, which has meant that I have had limited success with corals and lots of&nbsp;nuisance algae.&nbsp;But whilst I eventually gave up on keeping corals, the fish were very happy and the entire system sort of ended up in a kind of equilibrium. It's a perfect example of what a tank ends up like if you do nothing apart from replenish the basics. I ended up living with the algae, it's a bit reminiscent of my old planted tropical tank and most visitors are completely unaware that the aglae was not planted intentionally.</p><p>So about 6 months back I decided that I was going to have another go at getting things back in check and keeping some corals. I decided to go with vinegar dosing to bring down the nitrates. I followed the typical recommendations of increasing until nitrates had reduced and then halving the rate to a maintenance dose. This has now kept my nitrates steady at 0.1ppm. Great news.&nbsp;<span>The next challenge was red</span><span>ucing the phosphates.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I decided that for me I don't really want to undertake anything that requires the need for purchasing proprietary chemicals. I'm happy with Randys Two part mix (plus magnesium) as I can mix it up myself and it's dirt cheap. Plus as I mix 3&nbsp;litres at a time it's months between needing to swap the bottles on my dosing pumps. So any phosphate solution would need to follow similar principles.</p><p>Many people had good&nbsp;success with algae scrubbers or algae reactors. This kind of solution made sense to me as I figured that if algae is growing in the tank, why not grow it somewhere that I can control it. So looking at the available space I had left in the sump I decided that a DIY algae reactor was probably the go, plus if it failed to give good results I could result to running GFO. I did have some thoughts about how running vinegar dosing at the same time would affect the performance, but decided to go ahead, figuring that I could always cut back on the vinegar&nbsp;dosing if needs be. I also considered that whilst the algae and vinegar methods are competing for the same nutrients, they do so in a different manner and so could probably work side by side very well with a little tuning.&nbsp;</p><p>I looked around for a suitable reactor and decided on a Marine Sources 2.2L reactor. I also&nbsp;ordered some strip LEDs - 5 metres of water-proof&nbsp;3:1 Red:Blue, as from what I could research these were the best combination to promote growth.&nbsp; I fixed one end of the LED strip to the reactor using a cable-tie and then wrapped about half of the strip around the reactor securing the other end with another cable-tie. I plumbed the unit in with an old powerhead I had.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></div><div class="ebd-block  " data-type="image" style="text-align: center;"><div class="eb-image style-clear">

				</div></div><div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text" ><p>&nbsp;The unit is good in that I can hang it off of the side of my sump so it does not take up any space inside the sump itself which is at a bit of a premium. Here's a shot of it installed. I've wrapped some alufoil around it to try and keep stray light out of the sump as much as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>There's quite a few reports of DIY reactors failing due to cracking, which is often cited as being a product of the&nbsp;heat generated by the LEDs, however, I'm not convinced that this is the actual&nbsp;failure mode in this case. In short the material is a thermoplastic that requires a few hundred degrees before it changes it's molecular structure so some heat from LEDs, whilst being actively cooled on the inside from flowing water is unlikely to do anything. I think that it is much more likely that the failures (cracked plastic) have been due to UV degradation of the plastic.</p></div><div class="ebd-block  " data-type="image" style="text-align: center;"><div class="eb-image style-clear">

				</div></div><div class="ebd-block  " data-type="text" ><p>The tank is currently in one of it's algae die-off stages. The growth and re-growth of the algae is a cyclical occurrence, which if left naturally seems to have a grow-die-grow-die lifecycle. I'm hoping&nbsp;that now when the cycle is in the die off stage&nbsp;the chaeto reactor will take up those nutrients before any new algae grows back. Of course this all depends on how much uptake the reactor can take. It might take a few cycles to get it all. Of course I'm manually removing it too as much as I can, which has resulted in some interesting 3D printed implements. :D&nbsp;</p></div>
