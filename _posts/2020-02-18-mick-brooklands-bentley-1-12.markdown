	 commented on this post about 6 months ago</p><p>Forgot to post about this. I found some cool looking gauges when I was having a sort through some parts the other day. They came supplied with another project I bought. I'm not going to use them on the other project as they don't really fit with the style, but I think they will look great on the cyclekart. Might even try and hook up the speedo.</p><p>Post is under moderation</p></div>
