Why is it that plugin and extension designers feel the need to make their admin interfaces completely different from the parent product? Bright colours and shitty icons make their admin interfaces look like a garish nightmare. Same with the front end renderings as well. FFS, it's like someone let a monkey loose with a pot of crayons. <br />
<br />
I've had to dismiss half a dozen plugins tonight just because I could not bear looking at the shitty interface every time I wanted to use them. <br />

Leave the styling to the end user eh. <br />
