# Code Masturbation

Code for the sake of code.

making something overly complex just for the sake of it. 

## Spaghetti logic

Why use one function and three lines of code when you can create the coding equivalent of a Heath Robinson contraption

## Bloatware

No one writes code any more.

Why code when you can use a library instead.

Why use one line of code when you can use 20,000

## Geek Pron

Code complexity is like porn for geeks. 

Everyone is going on about how great (insert language / library here) is. Yet no one understands it and worse, no one wants to admit to not understanding it

It's a paradox.

## Bootstrapon

Another library. Bootstrap.

This time it's a visual library that makes everyones websites look the same.

Despite this EVERYONE loves it

## Prima Donnas

Everyone else is wrong. There is only one way to write good code.

## Russian Doll Effect



## Improvement Phallacy
