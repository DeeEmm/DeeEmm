I have an idea to create a WiFi pendant using an MPG jog-wheel, axis and speed selectors in a pendant with it's own ESP32 controller. It would probably be trivial enough to squeeze an ESP32 into one of those cheap MPG pendants you can buy on ebay. It can then communicate via WiFi with the GRBL-ESP32 or ESP3D-WEB-UI. This bypasses the need for additional I/O and potentially even code changes within the GRBL-ESP32 core if it utilises existing communication protocols. Theoretically any command that you can currently use in the web interface can be mimic'd / duped by another ESP32 posing as a browser. I'd be keen
