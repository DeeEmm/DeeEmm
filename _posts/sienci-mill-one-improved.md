I've been a fan of the Sienci Mill One since it was originally launched back in 2016 but I've only just decided to build one. Over the past few months I've been slowly putting together a new and improved version of the Mill One with the intention of being able to machine small aluminium parts. I decided to stick with the Mill One rather than swap to a more rigid machine as I really like the enclosed design. 

I've made a number of improvements to address the shortcomings noted by other Mill One users to help improve the accuracy of the machine. This includes adding thrust washers to each of the axis, making the carriages from aluminium, using heavy duty brackets for the frame and adding a proper T-Slot bed. These improvements have helped to increase rigidity and reduce deflection. Initial tests have shown a repeatability of about 0.1mm which is more than adequate for my needs although I will concede that this is measured without any tool load applied. 

One thing to note is that the centrally mounted Y axis carriage tends to promote deflection the further you get from the centreline of the bed, which means that larger parts will likely be less accurate. Whilst I did consider designing this issue out by moving the rails for Y axis to the sides of the bed (much like the Long Mill that replaced the Mill One) I decided to keep the standard design as I wanted to see just how accurate it could be. It also seemed that the biggest deflection was due to the the lack of thrust bearings, which has been addressed with this design. It is also a proof of concept as anyone should be able to take the standard open source Mill One design, apply the same modifications to it and get similar results.

To go along with my Mill One I've also been working on some improved software that runs from an ESP32 which gives the machine web capabilities allowing it to be accessed and controlled via a web interface. This is an adaptation of ESP32-GRBL which also includes auto part levelling which is necessary for PCB manufacture. The final version is still however some way off.

The video is a walk through of where I'm up to.
