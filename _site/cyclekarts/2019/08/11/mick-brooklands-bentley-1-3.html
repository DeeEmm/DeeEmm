<meta name="description" content="Had a bit of time this arvo so decided to take a look at the front spindles today. The basic design uses 5/8&quot; UNF bolts for the spindles along with 6202.2 bearings. The bolts are generally welded to some pipe or tube which pivot on a high tensile bolt or pin. Pretty basic stuff really. You can of course buy these, but as I like to make things, that&#39;s what I did.I decided to make the vertical links out of 1&quot; bright bar to fit the M12 high tensile bolts that I&#39;m using for the king pins (plus I already had a length of this that I bought to make the rear axle from). By making them to fit I could ensure that there was minimal play in the king pin, and I could also machine them to length so that they fitted perfectly within the hangars I had previously made.I set the length so that two thrust washers would fit above the vertical link. These washer will help reduce friction and make the steering a little easier to turn.After stamping the hangers and vertical links with &#39;L&#39; &amp; &#39;R&#39; so I knew which one went where, I then cranked up the TIG and welded them up. Hopefully they are strong enough.Next up I need to drill out the hangers for the king pins and weld some retaining tabs to the pivot bolts to retain them in position. I&#39;ll also add some grease zerks so that they can be lubricated, once I&#39;ve figured out the range of movement." />
