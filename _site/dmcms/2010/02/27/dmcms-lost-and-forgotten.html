<meta name="description" content="Development on DMCMS has laid dormant for a while, and to most it probably seems like it has been abandoned. Work commitments, managing websites, becoming a father, running my own business, renovating a house, building a car or two, plus various other projects take up lots of time, and I end up finding that I have none left to do things like develop DMCMS. Last year I actually picked up from where I had left off and rewrote the current 0.7.6 version to release it as a branch of the main code - `DMCMS Light Version 1`. A lot of progress was also made on the Version 0.8.0 code, with many features production ready. Unfortunately we suffered a break in at our premises, and both the laptop the code was developed on, and the backup drive were stolen. Unfortunately, as a result of this, all of the development files were lost, as I had not committed any changes to CVS. Having just updated the site, I just noticed that most of the work on the 0.7.6 release was uploaded here - the old site was running from it as it was one of my live test sites. So with a little work, I should be able to get back to the same status - a production ready version 1. At this stage I am not completely sure what status the code is at - there may have been other untested changes that were lost, but the main part of the re-write - a change in file structure - is very obviously still intact. When I get time, I will have an audit. Unfortunately, the theft, and the loss of most of 0.8.0 has now made me have a bit of a rethink about what to do with it, and at present, I am not sure whether I will continue. There is simply too much ground to make up. If anything, a full rewrite might be both a quicker option, and one that brings DMCMS up to date. There are a lot of well thought out aspects of DMCMS, but there are many aspects that do not lend themselves well to managing a user-base, and extensibility - both things that were not considered way back in 2004 when I first started writing it. There are a lot of lessons learned, and there have also been many advances with technology in the past 6 years, and whilst I may not have the actual code written - There is always a complete CMS mapped out in my head - I just need to figure out how to get it into my laptop as typing it simply takes too long. Roll on Bio-Data-Link. :) So, whilst talking of lessons learned - there is one that I can impart for free in the hope that someone else does not suffer the same fate that I did. External hard drives are a wonder of technology - for those of use who have been around for a while, we would never have thought it possible that you could get 500Gb or even 1Tb in a portable drive enclosure - storage that is in addition to your main hard drive (my first computer had 16k RAM - and that was it - lol). So using an external hard drive as a backup drive is perfect - especially with something like time machine on the Mac - plus with a Macbook what better way to backup - you even get to do it on the road. Perfect! Or is it?? When my laptop was stolen, the backup drive was stolen as well - mostly as it was plugged into the Macbook. Whilst this is fine for data integrity (it&#39;s unlikely that both hard drives will fail) it&#39;s not so good for security. So my tip for today is never leave your back drive and laptop in the same location. Obvious? maybe, but I never considered that someone would go to the lengths they did to steal mine. Just my 02c for today." />
