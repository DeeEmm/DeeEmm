<meta name="description" content="Just a very quick tutorial this time.i was looking for a way to create a block that didn&#39;t have the normal border and header so that I could add in my own custom HTML. After looking through the code, this is very easy to do - in fact it doesn;t even really need a modification (well not in the traditional sense of the word).Basically what you need to do is this... Go to the Page Builder in the admin interface Create a block by dragging the &#39;Simple HTML&#39; sample into position. Add your HTML / text etc, give it a meaningful caption and save it Now you will need to get access to your database by using something like phpMyAdmin. Go to the &#39;Page Compose&#39; table and find the entry for your newly added block - TIP look for the same caption Now edit this record so that the value of &#39;Design Box&#39; is 0 Now you can checkout your new border-less block by viewing your site in a browser.
