<meta name="description" content="This is one of those issues that has annoyed the heck out of most Dolphin users, and one that has been put in the &#39;too hard basket&#39; by the dolphin devs. The &#39;fix&#39;, however, is pretty easy. Just a bit of background info - one of the reasons given for not fixing the issue is that it is too hard to determine which photos should be displayed and which should not. well I would like to call big fat bullshit on that one - if you can determine that you have to display a bug blue padlock, you can certainly determine that it does not have to be displayed at all. The following fix is simply a hack - all we do is hide the div that contains the nasty blue padlock. This means that the code still gets processed as before - there are no extra overheads, it will not adversely affect your site. And, although this is not the most elegant way of&nbsp;achieving&nbsp;this, the actual solution still involves more or less the same amount of processing. To note - a better way might be to add an admin setting to allow users to select to display it / hide it. Anyway, here it is... Edit photos/templates/base/browse_unit_private.html Find the following &nbsp; &nbsp; class=&quot;sys_file_search_unit bx_videos_search_unit&quot; change it to &nbsp; &nbsp; class=&quot;sys_file_search_unit bx_videos_search_unit&quot; style=&quot;display:none !important&quot; &nbsp; Job Done. Easy. Quick. Painless. &nbsp; You can also do the same to the videos section as well by editing videos/templates/base/browse_unit_private.html /DM" />
