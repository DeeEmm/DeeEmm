<meta name="description" content="{jcomments off}Trying to get the latest incarnation of DMCMS ready for release seems to be a never ending battle. Just when I thought that I had it licked something else crops up - and guess what!! - it&#39;s yet another IE flaw / bug / idiosynchracy. After redesigning the admin interface into a nice tabbed affair that put everything on one page in an easy to digest format I then find that it doesn&#39;t work in explorer. Phah - seems to be about par for the course recently. Now whilst this is really frustrating I wont declare to hate IE and it&#39;s odd renderings, after all, being a Firefox protagonist I am in the minority. IE is also the browser that I first discovered the internet on, so I must at least owe it something. My day today is being spent at home, which is great as I get to spend some time trying to finish the 0.8.0.beta release off whilst heating is being installed in the house. It&#39;s also great as I am now within swearing distance of an internet connection so I can try out some of the stuff that requires connectivity to the world wide wobble (such as user registration verification). I&#39;ve decided to load the latest offerings onto my webserver at home and test everything out, first thing I wanted to do was create a new CVS branch for my source repository - pretty easy stuff. Then I check out the latest branch as a release so that I can load it onto the server and update the existing DMCMS test installation. Wait....WTF??? There seems to be lots of extra files and folders in the released data - stuff that had been previously deleted (and commited). TSK. Try as hard as I might I can&#39;t seem to get a release without the extra files. I dont recall this happening before. Phah - yet another diversion to keep me from acheiving the goal of getting this thing finished off. I may yet give up. :( Update I &#39;fixed&#39; the issue of the old file / folder remains by creating a new CVS module only containing the new files. I apologise to those of you who have been checking out files from the dmcms module - you will now need to redirect your CVS clients to point at dmcms_080. But hey - maybe a new module for each release is a good idea??" />
