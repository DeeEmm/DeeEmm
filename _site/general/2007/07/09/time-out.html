<meta name="description" content="I will be taking some time out this week to get some stuff done around the house, this means it is likely that I won&#39;t be sitting in front of my computer too much. I&#39;ve been spending too much time trying to get everything finished off and neglecting my chores (which doesn&#39;t bode too well with the better half).After a quick tot-up I estimate that there are approximately 80 hours work left until the next (and hoipefully final) release is ready. There are a lot of new features planned including a full user based commenting / subscription system, reinstatement of the translation function (obviously working this time round) as well as a completely redesigned administration interface.A lot of the work has already been carried out and tested but will require further testing to make sure that it is reliable enough for release. The remaining items are either still in development or have yet to be started.The current release is hopefully stable enough that it will not cause any problems and so will likely remain as it is until the final release is ready.Some minor bug fixes have already been released and the packages updated to reflect the bugs found. As usual, if you find any errors / problems / bugs then don&#39;t hesitate to bring them to our attention, either as a Bug Tracker entry or in the forums.DM." />
