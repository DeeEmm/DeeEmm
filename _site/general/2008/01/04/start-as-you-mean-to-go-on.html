<meta name="description" content="With the first working week of the year at an end I am very pleased with myself - not only have I managed to release two DMCMS updates but I have also managed to keep my other resolutions too. The long long overdue security update was rolled out in Version 0.7.1 closely followed by another version to address a couple of small issues that were missed with the first release. Whilst only up for few hours the Version 0.7.1 release had 20 downloads - thats a lot of interest in such a short period of time - hopefully this is an indication of things to come.Work has continued on the Version 0.8.0 release with a number of items being crossed off of the To Do list. In a bid to keep visitors more informed I have added a &#39;Current Task&#39; to the To Do page to indicate what I&#39;m currently working on, I also split out the list into items scheduled for the next release (To Do List) and items for later releases (Wish List) - this has allowed me to review and remove a few items from the 0.8.0 release to speed up it&#39;s release. Hopefully this should provide an accurate status for future project development.Have you visited ohloh.net? Also worthy of mention is http://www.ohloh.net - Ohloh was started up in 2004 as a way of providing more visitbility into software development. Utilising a number of aids ohloh provides analytical data and project overviews in an easy to read format. Statistics can be viewed for both projects and contributors alike. In addition Kudos points can be awarded between members. Members can also add projects to &#39;Stacks&#39; (a personal colletions of projects) allowing projects to be suggested to them based on common choices. Naturally I added DMCMS as a project. The project page proides entries for RSS feeds, descriptions and after adding CVS information a breakdown of the content of the project is displayed. Amusingly the breakdown indicates that it would cost you approximately $844,130 if you wanted to hire a team to replicate DMCMS - And to think I gave it away for free - surely THAT should give me some kudos points." />
