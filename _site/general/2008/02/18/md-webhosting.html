I have been plagued by bad service from this provider since I started hosting with them last year - access to the email server would stop, as would access to the site, then it would start, then stop again... this seemed to be hourly.&nbsp; No amount of service calls seemed to bring about a resolution - the tech team&#39;s standard response seems to be clear your browsers cookies and then restart your browser... mmmmmnnn... ok? Well, a recent security breach left me pretty pissed - my site was hacked, filled with phishing software and then used as a launchpad for a spam assault - it would appear that the security breach was server wide - no doubt someone gaining access as root. I lost my site when they deleted it - with no warning and then had all my service requests ignored. All I can say is it is a good job that this site is not for profit - if I relied on it for an income I would be bankrupt by now. Well enough was enough - I&#39;ve now changed providers - hopefully the service should be a lot better. Mind you, I had the last laugh yesterday when MD Webhosting&#39;s site was down again - they&#39;re probably still getting hacked. My advice to anyone thinking of using MD Webhosting - DONT! They&#39;re not the cheapest and they&#39;re far from the best. Anyhows - that&#39;s enough ranting from me - Just thought I&#39;d add to the plethora of Google results that say MD Webhosting suck - guess I should have read a bit deeper before deciding to go with them. Please be patient whilst I get the site back up and running, hopefully it shouldn&#39;t take too long. I&#39;m limited for time at the moment so you may have to wait a while before I get the forum and Wiki back up. DM. &nbsp; UPDATE: 13:54:55&nbsp; 2008-02-22 - The Wiki and Forum are now back online.
