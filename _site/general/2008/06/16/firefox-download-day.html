Firefox have decided to try and set a world record for the highest number of downloads in one day by publicising the release day for the new Firefox 3 as Download Day 2008. To take part all you have to do is download Firefox - Simple huh? As a user of Ubuntu Hardy I&#39;ve already been introduced to the relevent merits of Firefox 3 as the beta version comes bundled with the Ubuntu Hardy package. I&#39;ve now been using it as my primary browser for the past month or so with no problems at all. The first thing I noticed about the new version of Firefox was that it appeared to run a lot faster than the older version - a definate plus for computer impatient people like myself - this is a real boom when using it for web developing - especially when constantly refreshing to check changes. My one gripe with the beta version was that many of the addons that I use were not ported and were not compatible - not really a problem at all - this is something that will obviously change with the production version as addon authors update to be compatible with the new version. So if you&#39;re already a user of Firefox 2 or want to upgrade your internet explorer to something a little better, why not update tomorrow and be a part of a new world record." />

<p>June 17th is 'Download Day' - the official release date for Firefox 3. Firefox have decided to try and set a world record for the highest number of downloads in one day by publicising the release day for the new Firefox 3 as Download Day 2008. To take part all you have to do is download Firefox - Simple huh?</p>
<p>As a user of Ubuntu Hardy I've already been introduced to the relevent merits of Firefox 3 as the beta version comes bundled with the Ubuntu Hardy package. I've now been using it as my primary browser for the past month or so with no problems at all.
