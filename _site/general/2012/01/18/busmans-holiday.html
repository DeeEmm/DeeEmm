<meta name="description" content="You would think that working on websites all the time i would have an up to date site myself, the problem is, that by the time I&#39;ve finished working on everyone else&#39;s stuff, i don&#39;t really feel like working on my own.&nbsp; Contrary to popular belief, there is actually a life outside of the internet (it&#39;s true :D ), and whilst it can be really hard to drag myself away from the monitor, I make a point of doing other (real and tangible) stuff wherever I can. This is especially true since having children. The upshot of this is that time is at a premium and my own sites suffer, nothing gets updated. So with new abandon, I&#39;m setting out to update DeeEmm.com. It&#39;s been long overdue, but the time has come to give the site a bit of a spruce up. i did take a bit of a look at this some time back, but as the site is still running from the old 1.5 version, the main reason for wanting to update was to upgrade to the newer 1.7 code. Unfortunately the jUpgrade code prescribed by Joomla for migrating to 1.7 did not seem to want to work, however, there is now a new version, and the test migration I performed last night worked flawlessly. At this time I&#39;m planning to migrate the info over, spruce up the template a little, and maybe (maybe), add a few new features in. One component that I&#39;ve been using quite a bit on other sites is EasyBlog from StackIdeas. This will probably see it&#39;s way into the update as it&#39;s much easier to use than publishing these posts via the Joomla interface. Plus, it comes with all of the bells and whistles that you would expect from an up to date blogging platform. In the past i&#39;ve advocated the use of Wordpress for Joomla by corephp for blogging needs on the Joomla patform. I even used this in my Dolphin to Joomla migrator. But whilst WordPress for Joomla is a great way to integrate the familiar blogging platform into your site, EasyBlog is actually more feature rich and believe it or not, much easier for a novice to use, which in my opinion is the right thing to have when trying to get your non tech savvy site members to start blogging. StackIdeas also have a couple of other great products, namely SectionX - a great (free) component for organising articles - perfect for the tutorials section here ;) and EasyDiscuss, a Yahoo answers type of Q&amp;A plugin, which may, or may not make an appearance. I&#39;m keen to replace the forums with it, but at the moment I&#39;m not 100% decided. So as you can see, there&#39;s things afoot here at the DeeEmm office, things that you will hopefully be seeing on the very near future. Watch this space. /DM" />
