<p>Hmmnnn, not good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I&nbsp;check&nbsp;the ACL to ensure that the 'registered' user level has login access to the site. All good there so that isn't the issue. I then turn to Google to see what that turns up and find that most of the solutions given&nbsp;relate&nbsp;to the ACL permissions.</p>

<p>The cause of the issue is somewhat odd and is related to the #__assets table.

<p style="text-align: left;">This will update all records except the very first record which should be the&nbsp;aforementioned&nbsp;'Root Asset'</p>
<p>You can&nbsp;verify&nbsp;that the Root Asset still has correct parent_id by running the following SQL Query&nbsp;</p>
<pre class="brush:sql">SELECT * FROM `#__assets` WHERE `id` = 0 OR `parent_id` = 0
</pre>
<p>This should return just the Root Asset record. If for some&nbsp;reason&nbsp;it does not you can correct this and set parent_id back to 0 with the following SQL Query</p>
