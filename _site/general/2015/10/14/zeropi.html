<meta name="description" content="Just backed the Zero Pi project on Kickstarter. Looks like a cheap and easy way to build a Raspberry Pi based 3D printer. I like that this opens up the potential for WiFi access with an integrated onboard web-server. This is the perfect combination for the Fabribot 3D printer that I am developing where browser based printer control is something that I would like to achieve. Imagine: Just open up your browser, navigate to your printers IP address. Upload a file and print. There&#39;s even the possibility of integrating onboard slicing - where you can send the printer an STL instead of G-Code. It&#39;s all pretty easy to achieve with a Linux based controller and a simple web interface. From what I understand there&#39;s a communications abstraction layer between the Arduino and RasPi aspects of the system, both of which also operate independently. This communications layer allows you to access Arduino I/O &amp; variables from within the Linux core and vice versa. The actual details are a little unclear but for adding a simple web interface to an Arduino an leveraging the power of linux to take care of file handing it seems to have all that is required. I&#39;m pretty excited about this. Guess now I need to get my game together and finish off the Fabribot      " />
