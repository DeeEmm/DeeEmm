		Just figuring out how to use Jekyll and migrate my existing page here from DeeEmm.com now that I have migrated my blog here from DeeEmm.com I’m so used to editing in HTML, gonna have to get used to markup. To be honest I’m not sure what’s best, after all HTML is itself markup language. I kinda like the purity of HTML and CSS, even though I entrust my web site to a CMS (which is...</li><li>

		I ran into the following error when trying to install MYSQL2 under gems. I was trying to install MYSQL2 to be able to import content from deeemm.com&nbsp;into my local jekyll dev site using the instructions posted here -&nbsp;https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/joomla3/ but kept getting an ssl dependency error.I got this error&nbsp; linking shared-object mysql2/mysql2.bundle ld: warning: directory not found for option '-L/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.Internal.sdk/usr/local/lib' ld: library not found for -lssl clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use...</li><li>

		I'm probably late to the game with this one but just&nbsp;discovered GitHub PagesGonna give it a test drive and then might migrate DeeEmm.com over thereMy only concern is that being owned by Micro$oft, there's every possibility that at some point in the future they may decide to drop this service, although to be fair a similar sentiment went through the ranks when M$ initially took over GitHub and that's been fine (So Far.)I've been thinking...</li><li>

		If you've read my post on dosing Lanthanum Chloride you might be trying to work out how to drip&nbsp;dose. Dosing machines tend to have programs that work for periodical dosing and not constant dosing, so they are not great when it comes to the regular drip-drip style dosing you need for Lanthanum Chloride.The best solution by far is to the regular hospital&nbsp;style drip bags and drop counter. This allows you to count drops, adjust the...</li><li>

		So a year down the track after building my algae reactor I've given up using it due to poor results. In the mean time I've tried a few other things to get my phos levels down... Growth was not as good as I would have liked with the algae reactor&nbsp;and in all honesty it could not compete with the display. So I decommissioned the algae reactor and filled it up with PhosGuard. The&nbsp;PhosGuard was better,...</li><li>

		I'm setting up a reef-pi controller on my tank. Reef-Pi is a DIY Raspberry-Pi based aquarium controller.&nbsp;I had considered making a simple controller using an Arduino, but when i was searching online I found&nbsp;the Reef-Pi project and decided it was perfect for my needs and would save a bunch of work and time. Win-Win! The main reason I was considering some kind of tank controller was just to control my lights with the eventual goal...</li><li>
