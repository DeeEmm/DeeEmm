We will be integrating the web side of our software services company into the DeeEmm brand, and providing a number of new features to our existing and future clients. One of the new features is an online marketplace where software modifications can be bought. We currently have hundreds of mods that we have developed that will be converted into downloadable products, some for free. We are also expanding our efforts into the Boonex Dolphin 7 CMS with new modifications planned for release.Other plans include a trouble ticket system and searchable knowledgebase for supported mods and products. The forums will also be reinstated to provide general product support and coding help. Existing client accounts will be converted and carried over. All existing clients will be emailed with new log in details after the migration has taken place. Our future plans include a shift in bias from our more traditional business of industrial software toward web based technologies, including web sites, hosting and domain management.We thank you for your patience in this transitional period. If you have any questions relating to existing accounts, or account migration to the new system, please feel free to contact us using the email address in your control panel, or the contact form on this site.DM. {jcomments off}" />
