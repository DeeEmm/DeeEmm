<meta name="description" content="Welcome to the new look DeeEmm website. The site has been re-developed to match a change in focus for our core business, by redirecting web based enquiries made at our main company to the DeeEmm site. The promotion of DeeEmm as a sales brand is to both provide a location for the promotion of our web services division, and also putting an existing resource to better use. What was once just my tech blog, will now become an online resource for providing web services and products. Along with the change in focus for the site, the business aspect of the change will also follow, with DeeEmm will now be run as a subsidiary of my main company. The split setup will allow a focus on web based products and services to be maintained as a separate entity from the main company endeavors, and will encompass a variety of products and services ranging from basic web design, and website management, to more technical solutions, such as remote PLC monitoring, and embedded web based control and monitoring systems. The new site includes features specifically geared toward the online supply and support of products in a digital medium, for both providing and supporting web based sales of software modifications, plugins and extensions, and allowing instant access to purchased products. The online store provides a convenient method by which customers can purchase and download products and the trouble ticket system provides support for installation and usage issues that may occur. We also offer a full knowledge-base of past issues for users to search. We will also offer design for other mediums, such as print, packaging and photography, as well as other electronic and non-electronic formats. The forums have now been reinstated, and subscribers also have access to private forums where dedicated support can be given. DM" />
