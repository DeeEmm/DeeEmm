The second modification is a Dolphin 7 MOD that creates a custom block for the groups home / view page that aggregates the groups forum posts.&nbsp; This increases the usefulness of the groups home page by providing all information in one place. As a bonus, we have also included an additional mod that will show you how to add a block anywhere on your site to aggregate ALL group forum posts into one block. Both mods are available for purchase either here, via the webstore, or via the Boonex marketplace. /DM" />
