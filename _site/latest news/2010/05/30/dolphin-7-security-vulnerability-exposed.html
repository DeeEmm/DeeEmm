This report is triggered by any number of bugs, and could easily be used to compromise a website or server. The security &#39;hole&#39; had previously been reported and raised as an issue with the Dolphin developers, who&#39;s response was that it had been addressed.

<p>The community were quick to act, with a couple of suggested workarounds published on modmysite - <a href="http://www.modmysite.com/general-issues-comments-questions/10491-db_full_visual_processing.html#post39764">http://www.modmysite.com/general-issues-comments-questions/10491-db_full_visual_processing.html#post39764</a> as well as on the Boonex site, but there has been no official response.<a href="http://www.modmysite.com/general-issues-comments-questions/10491-db_full_visual_processing.html#post39764"><br /></a></p>

<pre>Below are instructions including what file to check, <br />and what to change, to avoid this situation.<br />
Dolphin 7.0.x (inc/classes/BxDolDb.php)<br />Dolphin 6.0.x and 6.1.x (inc/db.inc.php)<br /><br />Look for the value, near the top of the file, like:<br /><br />define( 'DB_FULL_VISUAL_PROCESSING', true );<br /><br />It should be set to:<br />
define( 'DB_FULL_VISUAL_PROCESSING', false );<br />
Making this change will prevent users from seeing debug <br />information (some sensitive) in the event your site has <br />a database error.</pre>
