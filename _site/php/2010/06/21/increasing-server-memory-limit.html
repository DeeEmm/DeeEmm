If you have access to your servers php.ini file, this is relatively straightforward -&nbsp; simply increase the value of the memory_limit directive to 128M then restart apache. However, I&#39;m guessing that if you&#39;re reading this post, looking for a solution to memory issues, then the last sentence probably made little sense, and chances are that you do not have access to your servers php.ini file - this is true for most shared servers. If you do not have access, all is not lost - you can override the value in either a custom php.ini file, or via the htaccess file - the method needed depends on the following: If PHP is compiled to run as a cgi script then you will need to use a custom php.ini, but if it is compiled to run as a module then you will need to use htaccess. (tip - you can view your servers php_info() to find out which one) To set via php.ini&nbsp; file use the following syntax - add this to a file named php.ini and put it in your webroot memory_limit = 128M To set via htaccess - add this to your htaccess file php_value memory_limit 128M If you wish to set these values within your script - you can also use the ini set method from within php ini_set(&#39;memory_limit&#39;, &#39;On&#39;); You can also use the same methods to set other php.ini directives. However, not all directives are available for modification in this manner. For more info on available directives, see - http://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php /DM" />
