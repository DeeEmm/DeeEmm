	<h3>My new github.io page</h3>
  <p>Just figuring out how to use Jekyll and migrate my existing page here from DeeEmm.com</p>
  <p>I'm so used to editing in HTML, gonna have to get used to markup. To be honest I', not sure what's best, after all HTML is itself markup language. I kinda like the purity of HTML and CSS, even though I entrust my web site to a CMS (which is pretty much like cheating)</p>
  <p>So I guess that moving to jekyll is probably halfway between the two. Not quite as pure as writing in HTML & CSS, but not quite as dirty as using a CMS.</p>
  <p>I'm also telling myself that this move is going to reignite my blog a little. I do lots of projects on many different things, many of which I 'blog' about elsewhere. SO I would like to start posting more of that stuff here.</p>
  <p>For example, I have a bunch of Github projects that I never really include here, so moving 'here' to Github should really mean that I include those projects a lot more.</p>
  <p>I guess we will see.</p>
  <p>Right now I have to migrate images and write some scripts to change a whole bunch of dead links in my EasyBlog import</p>
  <p>BTW. I'm writing this in <a href="Prose">'Prose'</a>, an online editor. It's kinda cool. Nice and clean, no distractions, just a very basic source editor, it has a preview butting and a save button and that's about it. I think I might grow to like this. :)</p>
